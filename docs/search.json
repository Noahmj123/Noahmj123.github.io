So, lets make this a little more interactive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, now we know Michigan had a whopping 39,750 16 year old male drivers in 2015 and New Mexico had a measily 132 16 year old male drivers. It’s pretty interesting to see the 4th most populous state, New York, had only 5400 16 year old drivers compared to the 3rd most populous state, Florida, with 21,936. This is something that could really elevate a good research question, but is most likely due to around half of the population in New York being in New York City, so not many people bother to get a license with the subway system."

    "text": "Age Cohorts\nAnother interesting piece to look at would be what is the age cohort with the largest amount of drivers in each state? Lets see how well this looks in a static plot first:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot bad not bad. It’s crazy to see a state like West Virginia where the largest cohort is 60-64 year old drivers. Western States also have a higher prevalence of drivers in the 25-29 and 30-34 group while the Eastern states have a higher prevalence of drivers in the 50-45 and 55-59 groups. It is annoying having to look at the key everytime I want to check a states largest cohort so lets make this interactive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is much better for viewing our data. Now we are even able to zoom in to see that the District of Columbia has their cohort as 30-34 year old men and we don’t have to squint at Rhode Island. It’s also interesting how North and South Dakota have very young age for drivers while most of their bordering states are 55-59.\nRegardless, both static and interactive plots can be respectively more useful depending on what type of data you are wanting to use. When dealing with geographic data sets, interactive may be the better option and can keep a reader of your research more engaged and help them better understand what is truly being recorded. Interactive maps are a useful skill for our ever-growing toolkit of data visualizations and will be quite useful for my future projects."
