With a peak of around 4.5% of reviews containing a vulgar word for negative reviews compared to 2.6% for positive, there is a quite noticeable difference. Despite this, the positive reviews show multiple reviews reaching over 4 vulgar words which isn’t recorded once in the negative reviews. This could be possibly due to the much higher proportion of positive reviews and people loving the game so much they use a ton of vulgar language to describe their passion."

While these can also be downsides for a player, they are also very positive qualities.
