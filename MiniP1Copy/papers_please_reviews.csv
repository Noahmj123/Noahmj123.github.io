239030,"Papers, Please","I had no idea what I was getting into with this game. From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not. And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that. It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government. It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices. You sit in your little checkpoint booth. A man comes up and hands you his passport. You skim over the information and stamp a big green 'APPROVED' for him. He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, 'my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her.' Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman. There's her passport. You look down and see an expiration date of last month. 'This document is expired' you say. She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: 'Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me. Please let me in.' What do you do? Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son? Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away?  Papers, Please is not an easy game, nor is it free of consequences. Not only does it become insanely difficult to reivew piles of papers and make sure every little details is accrate and correct, but every choice you make determines who you are and the path you take. Will you work tirelessly for the glory of Arstotzka, or will you join the Order and be a part of the uprising against the tyrannical, corrupt government?",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please has no right to be as fun as it is. Papers, Please has no right to be as poignant as it is. Papers, Please has no right to be possibly the best PC game of 2013 I've played. Papers, Please is all of these things.  The gameplay of Papers, Please is more or less a tedium simulator. It's Paperwork: The Game. And yet, you know that you need to process as many of these poor people as you can so that your family won't starve. You know that the old lady who you just denied will probably never see her son again; you know the young man you just let through has less than glorious ambitions in your city. Will you support the rebels? Will you toe the party line? Will you let the young lady through, even though her passport is clearly fake, because her fiance was just before her and bribed you to do so? The choice in this game is staggering, and the simplicity of the game itself allows for complete assimilation of your mind into the mind of your character. You feel bad when your child gets sick, but you know that food is sometimes more important than heat.  Papers, Please is a work of video game brilliance - a work of art. I give it seven out of seven stars.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","East Grestin, 1982  Here comes that weird guy again. The one in the red sweater and with the crooked smile always plastered on his face. It's the third time already, this month. I look at him through the glass as he waves at me in an oddly familiar way that makes me feel a little bit awkward. «Old friend, hello! I am back again! This time everything set!». His voice is loud and cheerful, and I just can't help but wonder what the heck is wrong with him. There's nothing to be so happy about in this rotten place, you old geezer. «Papers, please» I simply say, ignoring his greetings.  He grins while handing me his brand new passport. I chuckle. Definitely better than the last one, at least this one is not pre-approved. «So this time you're from Obristan, I see, Mr... Jorji Costava? Is this even your real name?». His grin grows even wider and he starts laughing again. «You a funny guy. I didn't like Cobrastan that much anymore. Obristan sure is a better country». He speaks with a tick foreign accent that makes me wonder where he is really from.  «Cobrastan isn't even a real country, in the first place» I point out matter-of-factly. «Where's your entry ticket?». His smile fades a little.  «Arstotzka so great, we don't need an entry ticket!».  «This is the same thing you said last time about passports. I'm sorry, an entry ticket is required». I hand his passport back. «Wow, you run very strict border here». He puts his paper back in the pocket of his trousers, shrugging. «That is good. Do job right. I look for entry thing and come back». Before leaving the booth, he stares intensely at me. «You a good guy, but I have business in Arstotzka. I see you soon». He waves me goodbye and then disappears in the crowd, with that big careless smile on his face.   *  I keep staring at the ceiling of my bedroom. In the end, it seems I can't really sleep at all tonight. I can hear my wife coughing weakly beside me. The doctor said it's just a cold, but she's getting worse day after day. I'm slightly worried. Our son is sleeping in the next room, the only one lit by the sun in the morning. He is turning 7 next week. I'd really want to buy him a special present for his birthday. We are currently living in a small apartment provided by the Ministry of Admission, here in East Grestin. The rooms are small and the heather doesn't work half the time. On top of that, our neighbours are awfully nosy. Living here is not that great, but there's really nothing I can do about it.   *  A week has passed since Jorji Costava last showed up. Maybe he is having a hard time finding a fake entry permit. Maybe he just gave up. Quite unlikely. The siren's ringing, another day of work is starting.  A tall figure silently enters the booth. He's wearing a green hood and his face is hidden behind a grey mask. I'm about to call the security, but he gently slides a paper note under the window and stares at me. «There's no much time, be quick please». His voice sounds young- he's probably younger than me- and unusually relaxed. My hands are shaking and I don't even know why. There's an odd symbol drawn on top of the card, a star-shaped one. I slowly open the note and start reading. I can feel the masked guy's staring gaze on me.        ARSTOTZKA IS GREAT COUNTRY POISONED BY CORRUPT LEADERS  WAR HAS MADE GOV'T GREEDY AND PARANOID - YOU HAVE SEEN FOR YOURSELF  HELP US FREE ARSTOTZKA FROM ITS SHACKLES  + THE ORDER OF THE EZIC STAR       I'm in a cold sweat. I look up at the masked guy, I'm at a loss for words. «Our agents are ready», he helds out his hand, eyeing the card. «Starting tomorrow. Let them pass».     In Papers, Please you play as an immigration inspector working for the Ministry of Admission of Arstotzka in East Grestin. Your job is to check on people trying to enter Arstotzka and decide who can pass through the border and who has to be denied or even arrested. Most of the time, your decisions will lead to a different ending (not always a good one!). Choose wisely, the destiny of Arstotzka, your family and many other people is in your hands.    Pros:  -Well written dystopian settings -20 different endings -Lovely retro graphics -Jorji Costava -Great plot and sub-plots -Shooting terrorists from your inspection booth since 1982 -Did I already mention Jorji Costava?    Cons: -Maybe old school graphics are not everyone's cup of tea (I personally love it though) -Stamping visas and check out papers will probably sound boring to someone -There's no 'Escape to Obristan with your newfound best friend Jorji' ending  Papers, Please is hands-down one of my favorite games. Be sure to give it a try, you definitely won't regret it.",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","'Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas?' - Joseph Stalin   Congratulations! You've won the lottery and earned the 'right' to become a nameless, faceless little bureaucrat who is responsible from the border station of a fictional socialist country in 1980s, alongside countless entrants and their tons of paperwork. Glory to Arstotzka!  Before describing any kind of gameplay, I'd like to warn you:  Papers, Please  is a highly political satire that parodies Stalin's Russia, or any oppressive totalitarian regime in human history. The humor of the game is comedy noir: cold, immediate and careless with an appropriate dose of existentialism, presenting some genuine examples of your good old-fashioned political dystopia. If you like your sarcasm served cold, and patient enough to go through a simulation of routine banality to observe a comment on the dynamics of government, keep reading. The game manages to set the mood for it perfectly.   Papers, Please  doesn't even closely resemble any game that I've played so far. It is a basic simulation that lets you try and decide whomever is eligible to enter the country, and whomever is not. And guess what? The rules change daily, always getting more and more complicated until the point you cannot possibly 'not' hate the government. Endless political conflicts between the government, the neighboring countries and terrorist groups that are ever present don't make things easier or even safer. You live, work and try to earn enough to feed your family, but life is impossible for the honest as always. So things start to get interesting both financially and politically for our bureaucrat as the scenario progresses.  The game has 20 or so ending, which presents huge replayability and contains some hidden achievements to hunt for. As a plus, the game takes each save file for each day separately, so it is real easy to load a specific day and replay for the achievement or ending needed.  As the last call: I really liked the game, and probably gonna try to achievement hunt for a while. I advise the game for the curious, the bitter and the know-it-all. The graphic lovers won't find anything satisfactory though.  Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one unique snowflake in the massive ammount of Indie Games that is turning up lately on Steam. If you get to pick one Indie game to play, make it this one.  While playing it you will not only be confronted with moral dilemmas and unexpected inspections, you might also be encouraged to think about oppressive regimes and what they mean for the people that have to live in them. Bonus points to you if you start pondering about what a state should do for its citizens and what not.  And even if you are unable to grasp the deeper facettes of this game, you will have still a great time stamping 'Denied' or 'Approved' into Visa markings.  The game gets more and more complex the longer you play it. Discovering all the endings and unlocking Achievements also add to the fun. I also enjoyed the music in this game, its suprisingly nice.

239030,"Papers, Please","Two years ago I was detained on my way into America. I was taken away from the line, seperated from my passport and dumped in a bleak empty room filled with lines of chairs and people in various states of distress. Nobody told me what was happening. Occasionally an agent would appear at the back of the room and give passports to some of the people waiting, who left quickly and quietly. At one point an elderly man went up to the desk and begged to be let through, to be met with ice-cold condescension.  After about half an hour I was called through into the back room. There I was told to sit down in front of a man called Keane, on a desk filled with papers. Keane never looked at me. He asked where I was going and why I was going there. When I said I was visiting my girlfriend he leered and asked me if it was 'true love'. When I asked him whether I'd been pulled out of the line for a reason or if it was a random check, he told me it 'wasn't random'. When I asked him if I would make my flight in 20 minutes, he told me that it depended how fast I could run.  Eventually Keane gave me my passport back and told me to 'lift my heels up'. I missed my flight by minutes. I waited for an hour for the next flight and then another hour on the plane for it to take off.  This game made me feel sorry for Keane.  10/10, would feel empathy against my will again",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","Few jobs are more soul-sucking than sitting at a cramped desk and shuffling paperwork for hours on end. Now imagine doing that in an Eastern Bloc country during the height of the Cold War, with low pay, bleak conditions and the constant threat of being fired - or worse - if you screw up. Tedious, boring and stressful. Ideal subject matter for a video game, no? And yet Papers, Please is an unforgettable experience. It's been dubbed a 'paperwork simulator' - and that's not entirely inaccurate - but it's truly a game about freedom, power and how fleeting and illusory each can be.  An independent game designed by former Naughty Dog programmer Lucas Pope Papers, Please casts players as a border checkpoint officer in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka. Your job is simple, at least in concept: examine the documents of people who are trying to get into the country, and determine whether they're eligible for entry or should be turned away.  At first it's as easy as checking criteria like passport expiry dates, and rejecting paperwork that's invalid or forged. But before long, Papers, Please becomes a tension-filled juggling act, as you're cross-referencing work permits with identity cards, making sure the applicant's weight matches the value on their entry papers, checking fingerprint records and sometimes doing full-body scans for drugs and weapons.  Every new day adds new rules to follow and new layers of complexity, from making sure applicants' vaccinations are up to date to applying a draconian extra level of inspection for citizens of a rival nation. And every time you let mess up, you lose the money you'd have earned for properly processing that batch of paperwork.  To give the game a sense of grim consequence, your wages are tallied up at the end of each day, from which you must pay for rent, food, heat and medicine for your family. There's almost never enough money for everything... do you let your family go hungry in order to keep the heat on? When both your wife and son are sick and you can only afford medicine for one, who gets it? Despite the retro-flavoured visuals, the act of shuffling virtual papers is actually surprisingly tactile, and spotting a discrepancy and slamming the 'denied' stamp down on a person's passport imparts an odd thrill of power.  But not all decisions are clear-cut, and the game has 20 different endings depending on how things unfold. Do you let a man's pleading wife into the country, even though her paperwork isn't valid and the money it will cost you may mean you can't feed your family that night? Do you deny passage to the man who you suspect is a human trafficker, even though all his documents are in order? Who is behind the enigmatic organization that wants to overthrow the government, and do you dare get involved with their cause?  With a deluge of big-budget, high-profile games on the horizon, it might be easy to overlook a quiet, unusual game like Papers, Please. But don't do that, comrade. The consequences would be dire.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a puzzle, simulation game focused on the emotional task of working as an immigration officers, deciding who you let in and who you deny entry of. The game is based in a fictional country called Arstotzka.   The game play focuses around the work life of an immigration inspect at a boarder checkpoint. Players will inspect documents and using a selection of different tools to work out whether the papers meet all of the criteria to warrant access to crossing the boarder. When you do find a problem with the paper work presented to you, there is also the option to interrogate the applicant, which may result in the need for further information such as a full body scan or finger printers. Once you have worked out all of the paper work and questions being asked, you have to make a choice whether to Accept or deny entry, and then call the next person in line. Only then are you told any mistakes that you have made in the form of a warning slip.  On top of wading your way through all the paper work, you also have a time limit for the day in which you have to process as many applicants as possible. At the end of each working shift, you will earn money based on how many people have been processed, bribes collected, as well as deductions for any penalties you accrued. Then you must decided how to spend this money with your families budget, spending it on rent, food, heat and other necessities such as medicine or upgrades to your working environment.   Paper, Please has a very prominent sound track, which starts as a slow marching rhythm made by bass to represent flow of entrants in the line of applicants and how tired and depressed they are. Although the technical side of the music is basic, it is probably one of the most memorable soundtracks you will hear from a game.   The game is only as difficult as you make it; if you pay attention to every little detail, you shouldn't fail. Only if you missing key bits of information or just not paying attention in general will your warnings pile up, and you will start to get less and less money, which results in your bills not being paid, which then results in having to start all over.   The game took me a little over twenty hours to complete one run, there is just a huge amount of content to go through, although some of the applicants are scripted such as terrorists or smugglers, along with plot characters, a lot of the others are randomly generated which means no run should ever be the same.   Technically, I had no issues what so ever. It's a very technically simple game which can be played in Windows mode without problems either.  Papers, Please will certainly not be for everybody, but if you want to try something different from the regular shooting and spell casting games we are drowning in today, pick this up. I got over twenty hours of game play out of this awesome £6,99 title.   Glory to Arstotzka!   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is just awesome. It's a game where you play an immigration inspector. No, that's not meant sarcastically. I know it sounds dull, but let me tell you that it is absolutely not. It's challenging and interesting, even if the game lasts just a few hours.   With every level you play new challenges are unlocked and near the end of the game you have to take into consideration the many aspects of an inspection.  There are many moral choices to be made and in total there are 20 endings so there's also more than enough replayabily. An endless mode is also included so this game is neverending. You could play this game your whole life and not get bored. Ok, maybe after a few years you'd get bored, but theoretically you could just go on and on.  The graphics have a retro Russian vibe that really impressed me. And the soundtrack isn't very long, but what's there is very good. The song that was played during the credits was actually great.  In the end Papers Please was a delight to play. If only more games had gameplay this fun and an idea this original. Get this as soon as you have some money.  Glory to Arstotzka !

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an amazing game with an immersive story, fine music and great minimalistic art.  This game wasn't made for killing time. This game can and will kill you if you're not careful. It builds tension, it makes you question your morals, it makes you genuinely feel bad for your mistakes. It has the perfect atmosphere. You're in the shoes of a miserable inspector, checking miserable travellers, and the game will make you feel miserable just like them. It actually feels like having a job. And at the end of each day, you're happy that you made it through and that your son is still alive. It can't get more immersive than that, in my opinion.  The learning curve is steep, and I should say that for the less organized and less prepared players, it would take you a few restarts to learn a system to work it out. I know it did for me. But I wouldn't regret buying this game, it's great.  If what you want is a game that will make you suffer, get this.",1,1

Its got humor, saddness, happieness, and its all by your decisions. As a border checkpoint worker you decide the fate of civilians, immigrants, even your family. All these choices and how good you do your job is a real challenge especially further into the game. Now im only speaking for myself how great this game is, but it simply must be experienced.

239030,"Papers, Please","Welcome to Arstotzka, a country that has recently opened its border after a war with Kolechia and thanks to the labor lottery, you are the newest immigration inspector in this tumultuous region. Bluntly stated, 'Papers, Please' is a job simulator that has you checking for discrepancies between information. You'll look over permits, IDs and passports. Reading to what the people say vs what is in the information. After you look over everything, you will either approve or deny them. If you find anything questionable, you can have the game check for dependencies, by clicking on two specific things, such as their photo doesn't match their face and then ask them about it. Later in the game, you will unlock things such as searching people and finger printing them.  Each day will have a new issue that you need to check for. Another layer that you look for. The game first starts out by only letting your own citizens back into your country. Then opening the borders to everyone with a ticket, then people need a permit, then a work permit for those working and an ID for your own citizens. You'll see the issuing city that you'll need to check your rulebook to see if its really an issuing city, a gender that you'll get to search their gender even if it looks like a woman, they could be a man, detain people with contraband, question identities and fingerprint them, look at the date of entry vs the expiration date of their passport, look at when their work permit says they'll leave vs how long they told you they'll be in the country vs what they told you. Eventually, forgeries will happen that will force you to see correct official seals are there. It is a lot of information you need to look over.  The major controls are just mouse clicks and drags. You have a rulebook that you can click and drag onto your desk. All information you are given from people needs to be click and dragged into your work desk to look over. Then approving or denying requires you to click to take out your stampers, then move the passport into place and click the approve or deny, then give everything back to the person, by clicking and dragging it back to them. Once you've approved or denied them, then its time to click the speaker to call up the next person in line. Its a very click heavy game, but as time goes on you can purchase booth upgrades that lets you click space or tab to call up things you'd normally just click and drag.  Each person that you process earns you $5. If you make mistakes and approve or deny someone that you shouldn't you will receive no penalty the first two or three times. After that, you start losing $5. Why does money matter? You have 4 people at home with you, your wife, your son, your mother in law and your uncle. You spend money on rent, heat, food and medicine. If you don't have enough money you have to start sacrificing things. If you don't have heat, your family will start getting sick and need medicine. If you don't have food, eventually your family will die. When your family dies its game over. You need to be both thorough and efficient in the game, because you only have so much time in a day. Some days get stopped short with unavoidable terrorist attacks and bombings that cause new rules such as searching every Kolechian.  There are other game over states, like doing something incorrect in front of the wrong person. If you get a game over, you can restart from any previous day. This makes the game pretty forgiving.   As the days go on, a stories will unfold and you'll be responsible for the course of mini stories. You'll meet interesting characters such as diplomats, soldiers with bribes, inspectors, angry people cursing you out, human trafficers, secret agents, mysterious men.  In all, this is a very unique game if not job simulator with a good story, good art style and music that matches the game and back story. I can understand if this game isn't for everyone, but if you can get into it, Papers, Please will keep your attention in a lot of ways. Once you get endless mode unlocked, you have 3 categories: timed, perfect and endless complete with leader boards.",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please",Now my parents can't say I'm unemployed no more. 10/10 Glory to Arstotzka,1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please , is an indie game published in 2013 by Lucas Pope, which sees the player take control of an immigration officer at the border of the fictional country of  Arstotzka , a country based on the slew of authoritarian dictatorships that popped up in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. Set in 1982 after the conclusion of a six-year conflict between Arstotzka and neighboring Kolechia, the player, an immigration officer for Arsotzka, has to decide based on varying rules who is or isn't allowed to enter Arstotzka.  Throughout the game, the player will be faced with tasks largely based around morality: Should this poor old woman be allowed to enter despite her expired passport? Should this refugee be allowed despite his criminal record? Is Cobrastan a real country? The game isn't vague with things and makes it clear the differences presented to the player: Money or Morality? With a family of five (and a sixth possible to adopt) to feed, shelter, and heat, the stakes are much higher and less personal and more interpersonal; it becomes logical to deny the masses illegally trying to enter Arstotzka as long as you're able to keep your family alive.  The rules for who can get into the country tend to change daily in the story mode, and the game makes sure to not keep the player too tired or too familiar with a single rule setup; One day people from the United Federation will be barred due to a Polio outbreak there, another day they'll be allowed in as long as they bring a certificate that they were vaccinated. The game keeps the player on full alert, and tosses in new mechanics (terrorist attacks and rifles players can use to stop them, armed revolutionary groups willing to sneak through the border to overthrow the regime, etc) to keep the player both on edge and entertained, not allowing itself to fall flat or get boring during the 31 days the game has as its story mode.  In addition to story mode, there exists an endless mode which allows the player to compete against others internationally via Steam in regard to how many people they can get across in a period of time or other factors, such as how quick they can get through people correctly.  The game is a masterpiece in storytelling and narrative, and provides a great deal of stress and emotional impact with the player, along with excellent gameplay which is sure to keep your brain on high alert for a period of time after you finish up. I strongly suggest you buy this game if you enjoy 1984-esque worlds, or if you enjoy puzzle games in general.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","You're working in the booth one day, and you receive a note. The note tells you that there's a serial killer in line today, and that he's killed a man's son. That man is line behind him. The note implores you to let this killer into the country, so that the man can find him and take revenge for his son. Or, you can detain the killer and have him taken by the police.  However, on top of all this, you have a sick family at home. Your own son is very ill and you need money for food and medicine. You could be seriously penalized for letting EITHER of these men through if they don't have proper paperwork. Hell, do you even know if the man will be able to CATCH this killer? What if he fails? You'll have let a murderer walk freely into the country.  You have to make a decision quickly because any time you waste means less money for your family.  This is the kind of scenario you deal with in this game. At first it feels like just the bleak observational game where you just look at paperwork and allow/deny access. But as the game goes on, you'll be presented with these moral quandries that really test you. Any decision you make, be it morally good or bad, saintly or selfish, could have a range of consequences.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a testament to the power of games as a medium. It manages to be, all at once, an intellectual stimulation, an escape from reality, and social commentary. It is art, entertainment and work rolled into one. As the player, you are presented with a task that is very much like a lot of paper-pushing jobs out there. Yet here it becomes an intellectual challenge; a test of your mettle and attention. And somehow it is still fun. This is quite an accomplishment in terms of gameplay.  The story, meanwhile, is at once Orwellian and Kafkaesque. It is a kind of social commentary, but not on-the-nose; it is subtle, humourous, nuanced. The recurring characters, with very brief screen time, manage to be interesting and memorable. The Soviet aesthetic is superbly done in terms of design and graphics. The mechanics can be constraining sometimes, but that's part of its charm and challenge.  Above all, this is a game that is  sui generis , its own beast.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is yet another example of why the widespread notion that games “should first and foremost just be fun” is not only antiquated, but categorically false. Is a game that’s not “fun” bad? Of course not, we just need to expand our vocabularies a bit. Because Papers, Please simply isn’t fun at all and yet it’s a genuinely good game.  Papers, Please is a bureaucratic simulation game in which the player takes over the role of a customs official of a pseudo Eastern Bloc country at the end of 1982. After a long time, the borders are open once more and it is your job to make sure that the flood of people pouring in have all the necessary documents. Not only that, but you need to make sure that the passports haven’t expired, that the information provided checks out across multiple documents and so on. Rules change regularly due to domestic and international events such as terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks which constantly keeps you on your toes. You will also be provided with bulletins informing you about wanted criminals.  It is as laborious, mundane and monotonous as it sounds. And yet it’s incredibly compelling due to everything around it. You want to do a good job because you get financially penalized for multiple mistakes. Also, the more people you process, the more money you get. And you need that money because your family depends on you for rent, heating and food. But there are desperate people with insufficient or forged documents begging you to let them pass for various reasons. Some people will try to bribe you. Rebel organizations trying to bring down the government will seek your aid. All the while the government will be bearing down on you to do your job in accordance to the strict, but not always fair, rules.  And that’s what’s so brilliant about Papers, Please. You really get a feel of what it’s like, you get into the role and you start to think as if you’re really there and not just playing a game. Why wouldn’t I want to help these guys out? What has my government done for me aside from oppressing and threatening me? But what about my family? What will happen to them? So you juggle all of these thoughts and simply try to do what you feel is best in each particular situation. But there’s simply no way to do everything right, something always has to give.  You go through the story campaign day by day. There are 31 full days to play. To illustrate the many different ways your choices impact the game is the fact that the game has 20 different endings that can occur during various situations within that period. While the game does a really good job to convey its grim and bleak mood, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the dialogue is just unconvincing and unnatural. Also, for some reason, the game uses a bit of Soviet-esque broken English, but at the same time it uses some silly and very American colloquialisms. Apart from the story mode, there’s also the endless mode which you unlock when you get a certain ending, but by the time that you’ve seen most of what the story has to offer, chances are slim that you’ll be interested in more.  Papers, Please is a brave and wholly original game that deliberately offers mundane gameplay and wraps it up into a surprisingly compelling and profoundly affecting whole.  7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","A concept that is basically running immigration for an eastern-bloc country during the cold war. Sounds boring as hell, right? So deceitful it is then, because few things are more addicting. While playing, I kept finding myself thinking 'Just one more day, one more then off to bed'. Five hours later, it's 5AM and I'm due at work in three hours. No regrets here, either. The gameplay is simple but deep, and the story branches like a visual novel. Plus it's the only game I've ever played to truly make me actually feel -BAD- for doing what the game tells me to. Video game history teaches us that morality is black and white. Papers reveals how evoke it with more gray area than I ever thought a game could, and it's crazy how easily it does so.  There's a reason this game was voted GoTY by so many publications, and touted as simply amazing by gamers far and wide. Quirky, fun, addictive - you owe it to yourself to play this gem.

Overall I'd give this game a solid 10/10 for the most intriguing game I have played in awhile... (Excluding INSIDE).

239030,"Papers, Please","My opinion: Papers, Please was a game I really enjoyed, but is definitely not for everyone.  These types of games really captivate me, and when it was announced I was really intrigued. I love games that go beyond today's formula, game's that seek to push and explore new boundaries, even if they might fail. This game is certainly one of them.  But that same thing also hurts it, and some people might find this incredibly boring. You play as an immigration officer at a checkpoint in a fictional communist state, and you process people entering the country. As you can imagine, immigration officers don't have the most exciting job. It consists of checking to make sure their passports and papers are authentic, and if so, admitting them into the country. The gameplay is virtually the same throughout the game, but somehow it manages to captivate me, and clearly tons of others as well.  The gameplay, as I said before, is largely the same. In fact, it's almost entirely scripted for the most part. On day three a certain event happens, on day eleven another does, and there's no changing it. Despite that, however, there is still an incredible chance for a diverse experience. In fact, Papers, Please has 20 endings, each occurs as a result of you doing things a certain way, and there are still a lot of choices in this linear story. One thing I really enjoyed is how the game allows you to explore all those options. The game is set to have 31 days of work (there is an endless mode for those who complete the story) and once complete a day, you are allowed to start a semi-new game from that day and make a different decision. When each day takes around 15 minutes to complete, this was a brilliant addition that removed monotonous repeats that would've made me lose interest in a flash.

In this game it's all about noticing the detail and staying on your toes. The actual story of the game does not last all that long but it can be some trial and error figuring out how to get things done correctly and learning how to make things quicker for yourself so you can make more money. It also helps to memorize things as well. You also have some moral decisions to make to either help someone or make life easier for yourself.

239030,"Papers, Please","It's not as flashy as some 3D games, but it's beautiful. It isn't as loud as other games, but it's sensational. It's not as verbose as other story-focused games, yet it's very emotional, and managed to tell a story through your actions. Who knew that taking on the role of an immigration inspector could be so nerve-wracking, yet so rewarding at the same time. You just spend your time behind the desk; you approve or deny visas, and wish that at the end of the day, you've got enough money to feed your family some bread.  With your role as an inspector, you get to choose the fate of the immigrants and the country. People desperately want to get inside, and they'll do absolutely anything for an approval. Sometimes, more extreme solutions come into the minds of people, and they'll just climb over the border to be shot by guards. If you fail your duties, the country temporarily goes into a state of disarray, and employs tighter security measures which makes your job harder. A harder job means more papers. More papers means more time observing discrepancies. More time observing discrepancies means that the immigration line moves slower - and a slow line doesn't pay the bills. Don't be surprised if, by the end of the day, your family died of hunger just because you didn't work harder for the country.  It's very interesting to see how something so minimal, could be so powerful. The player works a mere desk job, yet becomes judge and protector of this fictional country. You connect entrants with their loved ones; you give immigrants better lives; you give people a new start - all with a single stamp.

In that way, it's a very realistic job simulator.  And later, you start to feel the importance of your work. It is not just stamping documents, It is determining peoples future, the safety of those you work with and your country, secret agencies.. And your family. Which, if you suck, will die much like Oregon Trail. It has a very organic measure of how well you're doing and how.  And all of that, mixed with the plotlines, the worry behind every decision, constantly balacing on a knifes' edge, the moments you need to pull the trigger, the sense of dissappointment if you miss a crucial detail and it ends up costing peoples lifes..

Your job is to give or refuse permission to enter your country to various people who come to your customs booth...... it is a hard sell, isn't it?  Okay then, your job is made more difficult in several ways. First of all, your bureaucratic government implements more and more rules as time goes on which means you have to be quicker and quicker at processing, without letting accuracy fall. Secondly, you have certain moral choices to make - you have to feed and warm your own family and that can only be done by processing people as quickly as possible.

At first you can approve only people from your country, after a day you can approve anyone that shows eligible to enter but there's a thing there, you need to verify discrepancies such as gender, emission date, etc.   You earn money for every person you get it right, allowing to enter or denying it's passage will earn you money if you get it right but if you make a mistake you will be penalized for it, the money is used to pay your apartment rent and to buy food for your family, yes you have a family in this game. This is where speed and attention comes to play, if you lack speed then you won't attend to many 'costumers', making you earn less money and if you lack attention and don't detect the discrepancies then you will get penalized for the people that either enters without being allowed or deny the ones that are clear to pass, easy, right?  Each day the game will get harder and harder but it will offer you new ways to deal with those people, just calm yourself down to do a good job and pay attention to every detail, and remember, glory to Arstotzka.",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","The gameplay is border control tedious paperwork. Verifying if different entries are coherent, checking for frauds or typos, asking people to provide more information. And then deciding if you let them through or not.  I have very little empathy to pixels, so I thought this was going to be easy. I would just accept people whose papers are fine, and then refuse people whose papers are not right even if they are dying and need an organ transplant.  But then the game got to me. There is so much more going on than just the little story of the person that comes to meet you. One person will tell you about another. Will give you something for another. Will try to bribe you, and you need the money to keep your own family afloat. There are events going on in the game's world, and it is subtly told through short sequences or short news reports. I have to give a file to a spy. Someone else comes, and tells me that he is also a spy, and the next person looking for the file is a bad guy. He gives me another file so I can switch for the fake. Which file do I choose to give, who do I trust?  And then I start to care. A girl tells me that her abusive boyfriend that beats her up and might end up killing her is coming. His papers are alright, but I still refuse to let him enter, and get a salary sanction for my decision. The game won, I was not just proceeding as if they were pixels and I started to make moral choices and get invested in my role.  This game is not exactly 'fun', but it is Art and worth trying to anyone that wants to see maturity in the video games medium. Very original, meaningful, and really well crafted.",1,0

The only reason I got it was becaues it was on sale. To my surprise, it ended up being one of my favorite indie games I own.  Yes, there actually is a story behind you approving and denying passports, a rather deep and compelling story. You work a job to provide for you and your family. As you work, things happen and your job slowly gets complicated. The game boils down to how quickly you can correctly sort documents and detect frauds amung the people who pass through your checkpoint. If you mess up, you get a pink slip, and slowly lose money if you mess up too much. If you can't afford to provide for your family, they slowly die, and as you need to live as well, there are plenty of choices to be made.  There isn't much else to say about Papers, Please except for it is an indie gem. With a good story and enjoyable gameplay, this is a must have and a must play; would pay full price for game.",1,1

The game world is quite convincing, the gameplay is very different and, even though it feels a bit like work and a bit repetive at times, the game has a nice challenge that makes me want to see what's next, with different variations added every day. It's also worth noting that the fact that you also need to earn money to survive and to feed everyone at home also makes you think about how you spend/make your money and have difficult moral choices. After playing the game for so many hours, though, if you make the right choices, you won't have to worry about money (tip: never move to another apartment, unless you really want the achievements).

239030,"Papers, Please","You were contacted by resistance. They threatened to kill you, if you don't let their operative through border. The contact left a cryptic note to you. You couldn't figure out the message in the note. So afraid of getting killed you randomly let couple people go through the border. One of these people happened to be a terrorist with backpack full of explosives. He detonated explosives after passing your checkpoint. One of the border guards got killed. You were glad you weren't fired. After day of work you barely get enough money to buy food for your family or heat for your apartment.    Papers please is a memory game, where you need to go through people's passports and other documents. Then you figure out, if you let them through border or not. The game starts with simple rules to remember to check, but difficulty advances over time. You start to get multiple rules to remember and gameplay can become really hectic.   The game has two modes. The first mode is a story mode. In the story mode you live through events, which of some are scripted and some randomised. You have some choices while story advances. Occasionally people can come to ask for your help. You can either be rewarded or being penalised for helping them. The story is limited to certain length and has multiple endings depending on choices you make. The other mode is called endless. It's completely randomised. Also time is not limited in this mode. You unlock this mode after playing story.  Overall the game captures really well grim atmosphere of cold war era communistic country.   Glory to Arstotzka!",1,1

You might think there is not much room for interpretation, that life at the border is simple: you grant admittance, or deny it, in accordance with the rules.

239030,"Papers, Please","I must congratulate Lucas Pope for being able to turn a mundane task into an entertaining experience. Never in my life I would have guessed I'd someday enjoy to examine passports and permits.   However, I am probably one of the few people not able to see a deeper message to this game. Ok yeah, dictatorship sucks, but we all know that. It doesn't really give you another point of view in the matter. Also, I did not feel some sort of conflict. If I deny someone, so what? There's one point in the game where you know that if you deny the woman ahead of you, she will be killed in her country. That's the only time you may feel a dilemma. I never thought I'd say that and I'm really sorry to do so, but the problem here is the graphics. There's just a bunch of pixels in front of me, not displaying any emotion whatsoever. I don't know what's wrong with me since everyone seem to be able to feel empathy toward those characters, but I really didn't care about her. It was a spoiled opportunity to make me infringe the strict rules of my country.   Also, the other side of the dilemma is supposed to be your family. If you don't do well your job, like if you accept someone that you shouldn't, you won't provide enough money to make them survive. This would be great if I felt attachment toward my family. The thing is that the only time you 'see' your family is between two days, on a static screen that displays 'Mother-in-law', 'Uncle', 'Wife' and 'Son'. Yeah, you don't get to see them, and you don't even know their name. So what if 'Uncle' die? Will I grieve?  As much as I love minimalism and believe graphics are not what make a game good, this game really would have benefit from better aesthetics. Regarding its emotional impact and its political statements, there is room to improvement.   In the end, I still recommend it because I love it very much as a GAME; sadly, it will not be more than that for me.",1,1

It's brutal. It's meticulous. It's Papers, Please. This well-known Indie gem became an instant favorite of mine upon finishing the first mission, and is one I both love and dread to play; love because of how fantastic it feels, dread because of how long I spend at one time playing. Thanks to Chaplainissar for purchasing this fantastic game for me (and to LockeProposal and Carsh who preread this review), I was able to play this cut-throat title about doing paperwork in an allotted time.

239030,"Papers, Please","I like it a lot, felt invested in my family despite them just being names on a board. Was legitimately shocked at pretty much each terrorist attack. The story keeps you engaged and I liked the moral choices.  I didn’t like some of the format. I’m sure its intentional, but the UI is so cramped and annoying that I can’t check everything in a decent amount of time. I’d also maybe prefer a better clock because I had some difficulty keeping track of time.  I played it as basically just somebody trying to survive. I min/maxed my warnings and people going through because I don’t give a ♥♥♥♥, its a job and I need money for my family. I’d also take bribes, especially after we got money confiscated because I couldn’t handle my family being sick or hungry.  Also supporting the order. Let agents through because I’m sick of the government and how they treat me, was willing to kill somebody I never met who was going to kill more people for the government, but wasn’t willing to expose myself and put the order above my own life.   Really, the game makes it amazingly simple to see why people might suddenly turn on their government. It starts as apathy, then bitterness, then somebody comes in and offers a better life or change and you suddenly see yourself actively working against the regime in slowly more questionable ways.

Well, me and my daughter fired this up tonight. We'd just put my lad to bed, at 9pm, after playing LEGO Marvel and was looking through what I had installed, so I could give my daughter the same amount of time on the PC as he did, to make it fair. I suggested she try it out as there was no point putting on a massive game for the sake of 60 minutes. Holy 'nards, was I wrong?? Before we knew it, and even bothered to look, it was 11:45pm. The time, literally, flew by.

239030,"Papers, Please","So first off, i'd like to just say this isn't a 'Border Patrol Simulator' as many might judge just by looking at it. This game teaches you that either you become a loyal and honest citizen of your country, or try to make a diffrence when the oppertunity arises. It gives you choice without just throwing options at you. You decide how you want to handle the situation, but you can't help everyone. So who are you going to save? Sounds a lot more than what ya think huh? I very highly recommend this game.  Also, before you give into the negitive reviews saying 'This game sucks! It's so repetitive' Or 'I can't understand it' You just haven't played/understood it enough to fully grasp what the game offers you. There is no tutorial. There are no hints. 'Except in the bulletin you're given.' And the rules change on a day to day basis. But that's to keep the intensity and change the aspect of the game to keep it from getting repetitive. Just like in real life, you are expected to understand your job even if you don't fully grasp how it goes. Adapt yourself and stop relying on mechanics to pop infront of your face. This game is certainly not for everyone, but i'd say give it a chance. You can always refund it. That is if you haven't been sucked in like I have.   **Also there are 20 endings.**",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","Many people like to argue about how 'fun' a game is, whenever they rate it. It is, in my opinion, a foolish concept of game criticism, as the 'level of fun' a game has is purely determined by subjectivity.  However, I can definitely say that most people out there wouldn't find Papers, Please fun. And my response to that is... that isn't the point.  I know not everyone on Steam is an adult, but if you grew up with video games, I'd certainly hope your tastes have matured. I have some conversations with 30-year-old men who still can't stop gushing about how great Super Mario Bros. is, even thought it's simply just a fun game, and nothing more. It has nothing to say about humanity, it has no high artistic value, but it is still a fun game.  But fun isn't what makes a game. I love Spec Ops: The Line, and that game made me feel like I had swallowed gravel.  Papers, Please hasn't made me feel like I've swallowed any gravel, but it has made me walk away with a new perspective on the world around me and about how video games, as a whole, can be narrated.  On the surface, Papers, Please is a relatively simple game in concept: you work for a border, check travelers' passes, and either let them enter Arstotzka, or deny then entry depending on their documentation. But it's how the game continues to expand on this gameplay and on its simple story, that things start to get more... interesting, as the game goes on.  The game, as many critics have complained, is indeed monotonous at times. I know checking the details of someone's passport to see if it matches their access pass doesn't appeal to many people, but if you ever wanted to simulate the life of a border inspector, this is a regular thing they would have to do. And it helps settle in that feeling of living in a lifeless country, where the only excitement you get it from the occasional denial of entry.  I get the same satisfaction from playing Papers, Please that I get from my day job: a box office cashier. Sure, my job isn't as detailed as the one in Papers, Please, but after processing hundreds of people to see the same movie over and over and over again, I always get some maniacal joy from telling spoiled families, 'Sorry, this showing is sold out.' Deep down, I grin menacingly, as I watch the passive mother turn sour, and ask if I'm joking. Like I'd bloody joke about a showing being sold out, you whiny b****.  Dark, intimate feelings aside, Papers, Please also offers a healthy dose of self-reflection on your own morality, by posing a lofty question: what would you do at your job if _____? Think of anything to fill in there, and the game throws it at you. Lovers being separated by the border, vigilantes seeking the murderer of their children, and people physically bribing you to let them in. It constantly makes you wonder where your loyality truly lies. Do you find morality in yourself? Perhaps in altruism? Or is it to the government, who gives you your daily pay, from which your family would not survive?  See, you can't just pass over every person carelessly, or accept every pass, because you'll receive citations. The first two of the day are just warnings, but after three starts pay dock. And you earn money from each person you process, so inspection is key. I've heard some friends complain about how hard the game is, but I only had my pay docked twice. I'm a very thorough inspector.  The design of the game's screens even enforces this feeling of isolation and dull monotony. Every day, you see your nonexistent family, read the paper, and walk to the same screen of work. However, the color palette isn't limited to just grey and brown. There's still some color variation in the people themselves, which is a unique design choice, as a man who appreciates aesthetic design.  I'm sure you can tell I really enjoyed Papers, Please. For a long time, I hailed The Last of Us as the best game of 2013... but now I'm beginning to have second doubts. I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to have 'fun' (whatever that is), but I do recommend it to anyone who wants to play something totally new. This is a fine addition to my new favorites list, and I'm giving Papers, Please a well-deserved 10/10.",1,0

I have never been turned down though, but have been treated in not the best of ways. Now I get the chance of putting myself in the border guard's shoes and can tell you, I have learned a lot.  The checking on the documents is mere formalism, the real lesson starts on whether or not to let a person with an expired passport or a missing document cross the border and enter your country after he has told you 'please, if I come back to my country I will be killed'. If you let that person pass, you will be fined with 5 credits, which don't seem much at first, but it will allow you to buy the medicine your son so much needs. It's the end of the Cold War, you have a family to mantain and every penny is needed. Sometimes you'll be given the opportunity to accept bribes, or detain people just to earn some money.

239030,"Papers, Please","The reactions people have to this game puzzle me.  You apparently are a border officer for what most people call an unfair communist style state, with reviewers often comparing it to the brexit or trumps wall or some nonesense  But..  -2 terrorist attacks in a week AT THE BORDER and the border remains open and even lets people from the offending country in with increased security.   -The searches on these people (Who almost ALL have controband or weapons on them) Stop simply because another nation asked nicely (Now that is just stupid)  -The worker (you) can make two BIG MISTAKES daily with just warnings (How many jobs do you know of where you can screw up badly twice a day and no one cares?)   -A massive nationwide fingerprint database is kept just in case your passport has bad info, so you can get in even with a misprint as long as your identity is confirmed.  How in the name of heck is this unfair or wrong? You Millenials are Reeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaly backwards and idealistic yanno.   Ok, im done poking fun at the stupidity of most modern gamers, now that youve flamingly downvoted this for not going along with what the gaming society thinks, lets talk about the game!   Its great! A puzzler about trying to check as many pieces of info as you can while compromising (Because you need to make enough money to stay alive at the end of every day) and keeping in mind, you get two mistakes daily before losing money, so if you have a desire to be charitable and take bribes, you can do it twice scot free, as long as you dont screw up anything else on that day, meaning perfection is something to chase as long as you possibly can (Because a 5 dollar bribe may have saved your son, but if its your third mistake, it will only pay for the citation you just earned)   Also, not often mentioned, this game is not a 'play once, die, repeat', you can go back to any previous day to retry it or retry your current day if you are messing up alot, its not 'permadeath'   A great way to stay sharp and give you some moral choices to think about.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Honest review no hype.  I can't play this game. I can't play because I know I can do better each time. This game is mental suicide for perfectionists. the game allows you to redo a level and branch off, the only problem is that each branch has to be connected, so if you played level 1-9 and wanted to go back and do level 2 better, you'd have to start a new branch at 2 stemming from #1 and all progress would be on another save for 3-9. that's the old 3-9, you need to play a new one.  For this reason I hate this game. But I love its style, I love it's story, I love Jorji, and I love to play it.  I will never finish it, and that makes me angry.

COUGH EIGHTY PERCENT OF DAMN INDIE GAMES OUT THERE COUGH. Papers, Please is quite relaxing and, in my honest opinion, gives a really nice feel of the 80's dictatorship and misery of the Eastern Europe. The game is as short as maybe 3 hours per average run if you're not speed stamping, but there are so many choices to be made that it comes with 20 different endings and great replayability. Your choices also seem to matter, and there are a few unique events with sort of a background story.

239030,"Papers, Please","Very cool game with a unique concept: You are an immigration inspector.  This game is so incredibly simple and clever. You can play the game entirely just with the mouse but most of the work is done with your brain. You need to verify immigrants' elligibility for entry in the glorious fictional country of Arstotzka and trust me, it  should  be verified.  You'll need to make sure that everyone's papers are in order. What's interesting is that you have to physically manage the immigrant's papers and yours and your space is limited. You'll quickly realize that it's fairly easy to deny entry to someone after finding a blatant mistake (Names don't match, passport is expired, passport ID doesn't match, immigrant is clearly NOT female... Or is she?). However, what's the most worrisome is when you cannot find anything wrong, because chances are there is.  You have a limited amount of time to pass as many immigrants as you can. Then, at the end of each day, you need to pay for rent, heat and food for your whole family. The game is rather cruel and you will most likely break even each day if you do alright... Otherwise you might not be able to afford heat and food, in which case your family will start starving and getting sick and eventually everybody will be dead.  The game has a really cool and unique style and feeling, the music is very cool (although most of the gameplay is silent). You'll have a good amount of play time if you're going for full completion, there is a story and several choices and outcomes. You will most definitely improve and get a sense of progression as you play. Going back to the earlier days in the game is a joke once you've completed the game once.  I would say that anyone who likes managing stuff, using their brain, Spot the difference games etc. should get this game, whether it's on sales or not.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please",A great game ! It not only plays in the 80's it also looks and sounds like a game from that era. You play a border-officer of a fictional Eastern Bloc country during the cold war.   Your job is to check the passports of immigrants and to decide who to let in and who to refuse. What sounds pretty boring turns out to be a quite fun puzzle game mixed with some elements from adventure games. You have to compare travel documents with your regulations and look for failures. Over time not only the regulations become more complicated also you get more and more efficient in your job and learn what to look for. Everytime you find a deviation in somebody's documents you get some sense of achievement. When you make too many mistakes on the other hand your salary will be cut short which will make your own survival and that of your family members harder.   The whole experience lasts 30 in-game days and it is kept interesting while confronting you with a lot of decisions - not only who to refuse and who to let in. Some of the game's 8-Bit graphics and sounds are quite iconic - e.g. the sound of the bulletin you get when you make a mistake. All in all this game tries something new and was definitely an interesting experience for me. Recommended to all open-minded gamers !,1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Introduction: Paperwork, the worst kind of work you will ever face once you get a job, it's boring, tedious and can make a man/woman insane. So how can a game about paperwork be one of the BEST games I've ever played?!  It's a game that requires a good eye for detail, patience and vigilance (no slacking!) This is a game that is both simple and complex at the same time.  PROS: + Immersive: - Unlike other games where you feel detached from the characters, Papers, Please will really really make you feel like you're there making a difference.  + Consequence based Story: - The story, if you look at it from a distance, is simple. Yet each and every decision you make affects the overall story. The morality system in this game is one of the best I've seen as of late.  + Simple but effective Artstyle: - It's pixel art but it does the job well in conveying it's message. Most people would appreciate its simplicity.  + Surprisingly complex mechanic: - The game is not a simple approve and reject kind of thing. Each and every aspect of the unique immigrants who tries to enter needs to be inspected (from the face, the name, the weight, height, place of origin etc.). The game WILL know if you missed something and promptly gives you a citation for it.  CONS: - Story is a bit short: - It would have been best if the story was stretched out more than it did. Although an endless mode is unlocked, I still think more side stories, more in-game events and more time could have been added. It has a lengthy gameplay, don't get me wrong.  - Needs more sound: - The base music in this game is good and does its job well. I do feel they should add a wee bit more. Not a whole orchestra, but an alternative to the usual thing.  CONCLUSION: 'Don't Judge a Game because of it's graphics' is a phrase that would wholly apply to Papers, Please.  It's a great game for a good price and a good re-playability and experience value.  MUST HAVE.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is ingenious. It actually feels like you are working an increasingly tougher job, and it's really quite stressful. However, in terms of originality, and sheer innovation, it is a brilliant game.   Much like a real job, Papers, Please is best played alongside a friend or two, and it helps to delegate inspection duties within the group. Do this, and you'll have some crazy times managing Arstotzka's border. It is a game full of surprises, and it nails the dystopian, Orwellian atmosphere perfectly. The art style fits well There is a real sense of immersion, right from the start, as you start learning the things you NEED to know, to do your job. And of course, just learning your job is not enough, as things constantly change, making your job harder and less bearable. Again, just like real life!  You'll want to start by learning the game's geography: neighbouring countries, and the major cities within each one. And since everything here is fictional and fantasy, you NEED to pay attention. There are things to learn, and you really need to organise yourself to work effectively. Otherwise you soon find yourself unable to buy medicine for your child, and your mother-in-law won't like you anymore (not sure she ever did, tbh). The game is quite frankly, amazing. It feels like hard work, and it feels just as rewarding...and sometimes just as punishing...  Either way, you'll always have a memorable experience whenever you play this.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is a very unusual game. I’m not even sure how I can describe it effectively. You play as a dude who checks passports for a fictional communist country. Sounds boring right? But so much drama happens. People try to bribe you, they tell you their sob stories, they try to smuggle weapons and drugs, your superiors are eager to punish you for any mistake you make, terrorists ask you for your help in overthrowing the government (and you can!), and if you mess up, either your family will starve, you’ll be arrested, or you might just die in a terrorist attack. There’s tons of different endings, and all of your actions have far-reaching consequences.  I used a walkthrough, because I didn’t find the gameplay very fun, I just wanted to experience the story. But I think the gameplay is supposed to NOT be fun. It’s supposed to be really stressful, and to put you in the shoes of the character you play. And maybe I cheapened the experience a bit by using that walkthrough. Oh well.  Anyway! The story was intense! It makes you really think about what effect your actions will have on others and yourself.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I do recommend this game... If you're able to tell apart minute details.  I have a sharp mind and it is so easy to miss one tiny detail.  You sit in a claustrophobic office, with a tiny desk. Your job starts off easy. Arstotzkans only.  Within a matter of in game days though... You get piled with countless pieces of paper. ID cards, fake information, work slips, entry tickets, contraband, the full vindaloo. And you have very little help. It's not big enough to fit everything on the desk and to even think about making it through a week.  Then you have EZIC, your family, people desperate to get through, sob stories, aggressive people.. But you have no choice but to stamp a big red X on their passport, sending them to their doom or stay in their problematic county...  Your family, food, heat, rent... Medicine if things get bad and death. The game is moral questioning and you really begin to feel the effects of what you're really doing. You can't slow down either, you need to keep pumping out those papers... Otherwise everyone suffers for it.  This game is ultimately the definition of a hard life. Class 8 living, a family to care for, a busy border line and all you have is an acceptance and denial stamp to your name. This is meant to be depressing. And it definitely hits home.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, please is, in my opinion one of the best examples of games as art. though the majority of the game play is doing the same thing multiple times in each level, the gameplay comes to life with the consequences of making a mistake. the consequences of your actions are what make this game as every decision and mistake you make have extrodinarily dark consequences as no matter what you do you are screwing over somobody's life, whether it be your family or some random person you encounter. highly recommended espectially for those who want a unique experience.",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","You might not believe it but Paper Please is one of the best game I have played. Let me tell you why.  In the game you are a dude that has been assigned a job at the border. Your task is to check the people going in your country, and see whether or not their papers are in order. Simple enough eh? Yeah, that's what I thought at first too.  The first day you will have to check passports only. Yeah, check the dude's face, see if matches the photo in the passport, check if the date of birth is valid and stuff like that.  It will take time for you to check stuff and make sure you did not miss anything. And here is the whole game challenge:  time management . You see, every dude you process gives you money. If you take too much time analyzing papers you will process less people so you get less money.  At the end of the day you have to pay for the rent, for food and heat. Yeah, there is that side of the game too. Your child might get a cold so you will have to buy medecine. It costs a lot. So much that you will have to switch between a day with food and a day without, but with the heaters on. Sad but true.  The game goes very deep in the story;  there actually is a strong narrative . Between your family life that shows how poor your country is, you will read the newspaper at the beginning of the day. It gives mandatory information like which country is at war (so that means immigrants leaving that said country) and criminals that are unnacounted for (they could show up at your booth... eh who knows right?)  The more you progress in the game, the more papers you will have to check. First passport then work permit. Yeah too many immigrants are 'stealing our jobs' so the government tells you to check work permits too now. Oh but some countries don't need those, but just a coupon instead. Yeah, we also forgot diplomatic papers and vaccination crap. Oh, this country refuses to import our goods? Today we'll teach 'em a lesson: do not accept work permit from THIS country only. Oh yeah? Some people are trying to smuggle shït? Here, now you get a scanner. Check for weapons and drugs. Don't miss anything.  'Hmmm sir, it is written here you are a woman...?' 'Yes I am, as you can see.' 'Uh, ok, please step into the scanner please.' [Bzzzzz] Scanner picture shows tïts and püssy. 'Okay, si-I mean ma'am, all your papers are in order, have a good day.' 'Thank you.'  True story. However this scanner stuff takes TIME. So during this process you will quickly take the habit to process other papers. Yeah optimization man, I gotta feed my family man.   Oh, you think that game's boring? Not at all. It's a challenge . To feed your family you will have to sometimes skip checks. Sometimes you will genuinely forget to check something, like is there day 31 in February...? Uhoh. You have a blame if you let someone in with wrong/forged papers, or if simply there was something weird but you did not ask the dude for precisions.  Looking at that dude walking in the country, not being sure you checked everything. You feel like you missed something but you don't know what... dude is still walking... and... he passes. No warning, no blame. Looks like he was legit afterall. [Breath of relief]  Too many warnings and you will have money penalty. Less money for your family. They will get sick, starve and die. Think about your kid, his birthday is coming very soon. You would like to buy him a present yeah? Then you gotta work faster. Stop looking into your help book if said city is really part of that country: learn it by heart. Same goes for the logos: learn them by heart so you won't waste time checking them in the help book.  Indeed, your are provided with a small book that contains everything you need to know about countries surrounding yours and valid logos and stuff. My advice: learn  everything by heart  as this will prevent you from going back and forth clicking on the pages and checkings stuff out.   Still seems boring to you?  Gotta learn stuff by heart are you crazy man? Okay, my final argument:  this game will improve you memory.   Trust me at first you will be lost, you will not have work habits. But the more you play, the more efficient you will become. Grab that passport and directly put it right below the overhead stamp machine. So if the guy is okay, just stamp. It will go right on the right page. No need to fiddle the passport around to stamp it after you have checked it.  Same goes for the information. Be fast but not TOO fast. Your brain will overdrive. Check the date... damn what's today's date? Yeah we are Friday, gotta remember dat. Damn, did he just say he wanted to work? I don't have the work permit. Oh shït no, today his country doesn't need a work permit but just a coupon...    See now?  Everything you will have to check will make your brain work. Remembering procedures that change everyday is tough. Nah, no coupon today. Yeah today we don't let those guys pass at all. Remember that. Hell, remember the people you've processed too.  'Papers please.' 'Oh hello. Have you seen my husband? He was a couple people before me in line...' 'Uhoh ma'am, you are missing a stamp here, I can't let you in.' 'PLEASE, please they will kill me if you don't let me in! It's war in my country!' 'Yeah but... I go a family you see... I--' 'I beg of you, let me pass, let me meet my husband on the other side. Please!' '....'  What will you do? Will you help people? Is she, really his wife? Could be a whôre yeah? A terrorist? Wait I think she has the same last name as this 'husband'. Hmmm.   Hard choices. Impossible decisions . Meeting people you see regulary at the border, having arrangements with gards to earn extra money. Taking bribes? Hmm risky...  Remember, remember that dude. Remember dates, remember criminals, remember to check the name on the vaccination paper, remember to give that business card to engineer people, remember to give that other business card to construction worker... yeah that will give you extra bucks and is not illegal. But you gotta remember. Gotta remember a lot of things.  The last levels of the game are... very hard. I just couldn't play more than a couple levels so overheated my brain was.  Though choices to make, and many unofficial 'things' to do at the same time. And, the  clock's ticking . Work hard to  save your family . Don't screw up and  remember .   Remember .  Now I cannot tell you everything you will have to check and remember. Part of the game is to actually make mistakes and learn from them. Also there is a  real story .

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please  is a great little Indie game which doesn't take up much disk space and is actually very fun to play just to pass the time. The play style is almost casual, but there is also a story mode that can become quite difficult.  My first impression of the game was mixed. I couldn't choose decisively if it was a good game or just decent game. I knew it had potential though and I did enjoy playing it. On the surface,  Papers, Please  may seem like an odd East-Berlin Checkpoint Guard Simulator, with pixel-styled graphics and nothing much more to do than stamp passports and analyze them. It seemed like it might be just one of those repetitive games that's fun to play every now and again...then I gave it a chance. Now, I must say that I do enjoy playing this game very much.  As the story mode progresses, you'll begin to understand your role, equipment, and use of analytical skills more thoroughly. In addition to your job, at the end of the day when you collect your pay you must take care of your family by using a simple budget system of Rent, Food, and Medicine. If you cannot take care of your 4 family members (i.e they stay Cold, Sick, Hungry) they will die. Once you get a week or more into the story, this is when the real fun begins. Crazy things begin to happen at your checkpoint. From terrorist attacks to people trying to sneak in drugs to women whose passport says they're male (and they aren't lying). When it all started to get crazy, I decided that this game is not as simple as I first thought. It's a great game and it deserves a play from any Indie game fan.   Pros:  - A 'Story Mode' in addition to an 'Endless' Mode (Unlockable) - Doesn't take up much space on any computer (About 40 mb) - Interesting Pixel-style artwork - Incidents that happen randomly or according to the story - Use a range of given tools to perform interrogations (if necessary). These tools include a strip-search camera, discrepancy detectors, and the ever handy Newspaper &amp; Rule Book. - Use the little money you make to keep your house heated and your family fed. If not, they'll starve and/or die. This is a fairly difficult objective considering your pay. - Addictive play - Fun story mode which will keep you wondering what the next day might bring. - 20 different possible endings   Cons:  - Some events in story mode will repeat themselves, but it helps to make to game flow along - The graphics were a turn off at first, but you get used to the style - There are only about 3 or 4 different sounds to represent the language (sounds like a mumbled mash of German and Russian). One of these sounds is 'Papers' grumbled by your character. - A  slight  learning curve (which will dissapear after playing through the story mode for a few days)   Verdict:  -  6.5/10    Papers, Please  happens to be a really fun Indie jewel. There are various tools you use as a customs officer to help you identify or interrogate people whose documents, IDs, papers, etc. don't match. There's nothing much more I can add besides what I've written. I can safely recommend this game to people who are open minded, love indie games, or just like break from the usual high-graphic, PC melting games of the now.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Have you ever fancied being a border inspector? Me neither. Papers, Please grants you a chance to try it anyway.  The background is grim: you only got the job because of a lottery. Arstotzkan border is a busy place, all kinds of shady people trying to get into the country that gives out a communist vibe. You make sure their papers are in order by meticulously checking each bit of information for the smallest mistakes. You do this manually by eye. It doesn't help that each day the ministry announces new, subsequently more bizarre rules for you to follow.  At first the user interface is confusing and it takes a while to get used to and see the logic behind. All the tutorial you'll get is in the instructions you're given each day. Interestingly, this adds to the all-encompassing dystopian feel that is well delivered by the pixelated graphics and ominous music.  The story elements are brilliantly woven into the protagonist's role, served with dark humour: you often have to make moral choices by either admitting or denying desperate immigrants or whether you'll help the insurgents. You generally can't do everything because the salary comes from admitting immigrants and you are fined for mistakes.  Keeping your family alive provides the motivation to keep doing a good job. Money is always tight and you have to manage your expenses after each day. Fortunately, being a border inspector in a corrupt country, you can make additional profit by accepting bribes and striking deals with the honest people you meet in your job.  Each playthrough, one month of game time, lasts approximately 4 hours but to complete everything will require several playthroughs: there are three different 'winning' endings and 20 different endings in total that depend on your choices and performance. Afterwards, there's the endless mode to pour hours into.  Striking into a niche as small as it gets, Papers, Please does a tremendous job at providing an interesting and even amusing experience as a border inspector. If you have an eye for detail and fancy scrutiny and perfection, you'll probably love this game. Otherwise you might want to check some gameplay videos first - it is a niche game after all.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","...Wow.  This is like rapid-fire Phoenix Wright. You have to check dozens of immigrants for contradictions in their paperwork, and determine whether they’re accepted or rejected. You’re paid (poorly) for however many passports you stamp correctly. If you don’t perform well, your family will die of sickness or starvation, or you’ll get arrested for going into debt. (Yes, going into debt is illegal now.)  But it’s a game that’s less about how well you check papers, and more about why you’re checking papers. You won’t get very far before the story starts getting really complicated, and you’ve got to start making some tough ethical decisions. Are you a true patriotic Arstotzkan, willing to uphold the law to the letter? Are you only in it for your family, willing to take juicy bribes from illegal smugglers? Or are you willing to help the shadow cult overthrow the Arstotzkan government?   This game files in the face of everyone who’s ever said that story and gameplay can’t be the same thing. It really makes you feel like you’re shaping the fate of a nation, or succumbing to it, just by sitting in a booth and deciding who gets across the border.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Seeing this game pop up in Featured Games lately, I thought I'd write a review for everyone considering it.  The game's concept is quite simple and a single playthrough takes just a few hours, most of the replayability comes from the many endings you can get depending on your actions through the 'month'.  While the concept of the game may sound simple, the mechanics are challenging enough to make it hard to keep focus, often because of time constraints, but even more often because of routine and repetition, that will make you glance over 'minor' details sooner or later if you're not careful.  The storyline(s) will definitely make you want to complete the game more than once. Also, the atmosphere is quite convincing and immersive, great retro-style pixel art graphics too. All in all, definitely worth checking out.",1,1

Straightforward rules, cruel punishment for violating them and real life situations which makes you either break them or follow to the end.  I've managed to complete this game in 4 hours and I really enjoyed it (it also have endless mode with leaderboard worldwide). Simple in style yet, it requires your full attention to detailes.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please!' is a weird game. At first you will say that the game is lame and boring. That developer wants you to work non-stop and just mocks you. But... 'The cowl does not make the monk' as they say. If you try it, or watch a good review - you will see that the game is not only interesting, but helpful. It will test and train your attention, memory and managing of chaos. In small working area you must keep a bunch of different papers and find on them different errors. Know what city is in that country and how it is written, remember the rules. But don’t be afraid. The game is novice-friendly. You start with small and grow day by day.   Game is in retro style and looks awful from the side, but it has some charm and an interesting and a branching story. You can finish the game with 20 different endings and a bunch of interesting meetings. Some moments can be funny, and some abusing. But still it can make you enjoy every single minute of gameplay.  For Achievement lovers there are 13 of them, and they are not so hard to take. Store doesn’t says it, but game was updated with Collection Cards.  I work in such direction and have enjoyed it. So I think you will enjoy it too. For me it’s a brilliant project. Have fun!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I knew nothing about this game beforehand except that you handle paperwork, which initially threw me off, as I can imagine happened with a lot of people.   I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I read about it on a comment on Reddit talking about some of this game's immersive aspects and I had to check it out, it was on sale anyway.  I was certainly not disappointed, though not as amazing and sandbox-like as I initially imagined from what I read, it's still top notch. The whole border inspector setup is a great storytelling device. You can for example purposefully incorrectly handle an immigrant, while the game doesn't specifically ask for you to do this, and notice the effects within the story, or notice it in the next day's newspaper. It's a branching story with 20! different endings. The story has both it's funny and serious moments, and keeps it well balanced. This game has a sense of humor within a dystopian setting, which I adore. Your 'health' in this game is basically your financial situation, being able to keep up with the bills and pay for food and your family's health. If they get sick, they need medicine, which costs money. There's no arbitrary bars or meters or anything, everything is explained within the story. This is what makes it immersive to me.   The way you manage paperwork in this game is actually hilariously similar to real life. Real life shortcuts and organizational skills translate well into this game. I actually feel like being a border inspector at times, and it sounds weird to say that. XD  Stylistically, the pixel art represents the Soviet Union inspired architecture, iconography, typography, etc. really well with a fitting colorscheme.  I recommend this game to anyone who is open minded towards new experimental gameplay ideas, as this is an interesting one. It certainly holds an aspect of challenge and rewards you for actually balancing accuracy and speed. The game becomes more challenging with time and the added challenge is explained within the story.  In short: It's something different and innovating that's fun and challenging, quite immersive (if you still have your sense of imagination) and has a branching storyline that can both be funny (albeit often in a dark way) and serious at appropriate times.  11/5 would buy again. Great example of a great indie game.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Quite a game. Everybody in the reviews is talking about the choices it puts you through, so I'll try to be a little different.  The game is so simple, yet complex at the same time. As you advance you have more paperwork, more stuff to check, you have to pay attention to every tiny detail and you can still see that stupid paper coming on your desk saying 'oh you didn't verify that, it was incorrect'. You have to manage money and juggle with it if you can't be fast at going through the people in line.  I really like how there are different outcomes, coming from your choices and everything you did. There is not really a story behind the game on its own. It's not about the inspector, not about the paperwork, not about the people in line. It's about it as a whole. As I've seen somewhere, very well pointed out, it can be compared to the Wall of Berlin.  Anyway. If you come here expecting a lot of action, I will be pretty straight forward with you. There is not much action and the gameplay is slow-paced. I still recommend this, though, it is a nice game and really gets your concentration on point.",1,0

Let the father get revenge for his murdered child or face a penalty that would leave your son without food tonight?

239030,"Papers, Please","Yah so you're probably thinking ah yes a new review. Wrong. This is just a random pavlova recipe cos you are probably hungry after surfing the reviews.  Ingredients  4 egg whites (5 if you are using small eggs)  250g pure icing sugar or fine castor sugar, sifted  ½ teaspoon white vinegar  1 tablespoon cornflour, sifted  Method  1. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius.  2. Prepare a baking tray by placing baking paper on it. Put a little melted butter or vegetable oil spray on the tray so that the paper will stay in one place while you are spooning the pavlova mix on to it.  3. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites on a medium setting until soft peaks form.  Once soft peaks appear, add the sugar all at once and beat the mixture for a minute or so on full speed. Do not stop the machine to add the sugar. It needs to be a continuous process to trap as much air as possible in the egg whites. You'll see the mixture change texture almost immediately, from loose, soft peaks to a more glossy, meringue-style mixture.  4. Turn the mixer up to high until the mixture thickens and the sugar has completely dissolved. It needs to reach the ribbon stage – when a spoonful of the meringue mixture poured back into the bowl sits on the surface like a ribbon.  5. Slow the machine, add the vinegar and let the beaters make three rotations, then remove the bowl from the mixer.  6. Sprinkle the cornflour over the egg white mixture and, using a clean spatula, gently fold in the cornflour – no more than six folds.  7. Spoon the mix on to the prepared tray and mould it into the shape you want. Kabboord prefers to leave it pretty heaped. Don't mess with the mix too much, though, as you want to get it in the oven quick smart. The other option is to use a preheated and lined tray. Speed is the key here.  8. Place the tray in the middle of the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 120 degrees Celsius. Don't use the fan.  9. Cook for 80-90 minutes but don't let the pavlova colour. You may see a little sugar syrup seep out of the bottom but the crust should be firm. Inside, it will be soft and marshmallowy.  10. Cool to room temperature and decorate using quark, Meredith goat's curd or mascarpone (cream is boring!) and your favourite toppings, such as chopped summer fruit or passionfruit custard.  Enjoy!

239030,"Papers, Please","For some reason I felt some sort of obligation to play this game. I wanted to play it, but almost because I felt like I was supposed to. So in some ways I wasn't really looking forward to the game itself, more like checking it off of some non-existent list. I'm unsure where this feeling came from, but considering the sale I figured I had to finally try it out. I'm glad I did.  Papers, Please is described as a “A Dystopian Document Thriller', which introduces the general setting but doesn't tell me much at all about how the game plays. Basically you are a new worker at a border checkpoint, responsible for maintaining security for your nation within the small role you have. At first you are just checking for minor discrepancies for incoming foreigners and returning natives, allowing those in who check out and turning those away who don't have everything in line. Meanwhile, you have a small family to bring home your wages to, making sure to keep on top of rent and heat and food so that they can at least survive in a not-ideal situation. The game is segmented into days over the course of a month, allowing for bite-size play sessions, and each serves as a savepoint from which you can retry in case you don't care for a certain outcome.   However, for each day that passes, the layers of complexity multiply, at first slowly and then the gameplay becomes increasingly more complex as the month heads towards its conclusion. While the first and most obvious way this manifests itself is the degree to which you have to use the information (documents) available to identify good and bad immigrants, the underlying 'dystopian' going-ons come further and further into the light until the game's sudden conclusion, which highly varies depending on your in-game decisions. Throughout the month you'll have to make moral judgments about whether to aid people who earnestly require you to bend the rules, or whether to take no nonsense and abide to the letter of the law while forsaking the goodwill (and generous bribes) of those you figuratively crush under your unrelenting bureaucratic boots. The end result is a lot of decision making, in which the right answer is not immediately obvious. It does allow you to roleplay to some degree, whether you make decisions as you yourself would, or whether you shoot for the fewest citations possible, or getting away with as many bribes as possible. Needless to say, the game suits itself to many, many replays.  It's quite astonishing how quickly and strongly this game sucked me in. 'Just one more day' became quite the excuse to keep playing regardless of how late it got or whether I originally intended to do something else. Before I knew it I had a couple family members sitting in front of the monitor, lending their eyeballs to double check what I might have missed",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","One popular criticism of this game is that it is unbelievably boring. These people are missing the point.  Yes, this game is unlike many other video games because it is poignant and is attempting to make some very serious social commentary.  Briefly, you are a customs agent for a country vaguely reminiscent of Cold War era Russia. Your job is to check the paperwork of all people attempting to enter your country. Those who check out are permitted to enter and the rest are either rejected or detained.  Your job is only part of the story. After work every day you struggle to provide food, heat, and medicine for your family. You can make more money if you process paperwork faster but this often results in mistakes and fines threatening to send you into debt or worse.  This game is not like a restaurant worker simulator because it has a clear message. Well, even the restaurant simulators are maybe suggesting you have some empathy for overworked servers.  This game makes a more serious point: Border crossings are dehumanizing for both those attempting to cross as well as for the employees. Those travelling are subject to invasive searches, embarassing questions, endless lines, and the potential for political violence against their persons. The employees in turn begin to treat the travellers not as humans but as cattle or a meal ticket. These workers must carry out the often arbitrary regulations of their country in a way that often divides famliers and destroys lives.  This is not a game that one can play forever. It is good for a couple play throughs and maybe a little exploration of the bonus modes. It does not take very long to get to the heart of this game. After a short time of playing you will start to feel hollow inside. And that is the point.  I cannot think of a game that has engaged the hearts and minds of players to contemplate very real political problems in this way. In closing, the game is not fun. The game is terrible. And this is the point.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","At first, the game seems simple. You stamp passports. But then, you must check tickets, then entry permits, then work passes, then terrorists come and next thing you know, you're going to check 7 different papers in one little screen. Some security, huh? Soon some organization comes and from there, things spiral out of control. That's the story portion. Then, once you're done, there is endless mode, which is pretty much what the title suggests, it's endless. But, there's not just one endless mode, there are, in a sense, 12 different modes you can choose from. You can choose what type of papers to check, and the style on how you want to play.   Very early on in the game, the game requires you make a major choice, thus meaning the game has a lot of replayability. Also, there are over 20 endings, which also add to the replayability. But, in order to do that, you have to make choices that may or may not affect gameplay. These endings can be endings that are refreshing, to just plain morbid endings. Sometimes, you don't even know you got an ending until the next day or few days after.  Although you meet people who talk in the form you will see a lot, there are some characters that have very special dialogue, or who are very memorable, like Jorji Costova, for example. He comes early on as a guy who has no papers, and every time he comes, he seems to be one step behind. That, to me, is something that is memorable, as every time I see him, I think, 'Jorji! What's wrong this time?'.   The only problems I have with this game are the discrepancies. Although mostly clear on what to do, sometimes when looking out for criminals, someone comes to the booth, and you highlight the man's face with the criminal's, and it says, 'NO CORRELATION' even though they look identical! But, other than that, I really have no complaints! Of course, someone might think differently, but that's my opinion on the matter.  The graphics are really crappy, on first glance, but it is very efficient and to me, this says, 'Just because a game has good graphics, doesn't mean a game is good.' And the opposite, 'Just because a game has bad graphics, doesn't mean that the game is utter crap.' I personally like the graphics, as they really match my stylings for this type of game. They are very simple and neat, and the slip screen is a really neat concept to me.  This game is amazing. 9.3/10 No doubt.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please Review  Papers, Please is a game about paperwork. Papers, Please is a game about 12 hour work days living life paycheck to paycheck. Papers, Please should not sound like a good game, and in theory it shouldn’t be. But Papers, Please is not just a good game, it is a great game.   You play as a border guard in the fictional country of Arstotzka, your job is to control the flow of immigrants and exterminate all who try and cheat the system. You must care for a family of 5 and your pay is very little. Mistakes are not tolerated and every error will be deducted from the small amount of money you are given. It is very easy to starve to death in Papers, Please; death and insignificance play a large part in the overall theme of the game. You are not the hero, you are not important, if you fail to live up to expectations you will be replaced in a matter of hours.   The heavy themes that Papers, Please possess are what make the experience so great, its depictions of war in the 20th century are expressed so well in the colorless background. There isn’t a single happy thought in Papers, Please. The whole game has a depressing feel to it, but this is what the creator was aiming for. He wasn’t trying to make a fantasy where everything is good and right in the world; his approach is honest and sinister.  The sensational achievement that is Papers, Please art design is not enough on its own to be worth playing, but with the addition of its intriguing gameplay mechanics and consistent challenge makes for a level of enjoyment other artistic games miss, Papers, Please is not great because of its perfection at simulating paperwork, or its ability to depict gruesome settings and artistic impurity. It is great because it can balance the two elements so well and make for an experience like no other.  Papers, Please proves that a game doesn’t need a million dollar budget and a team of thousands of developers to be good. Papers, Please was made by one man and standing up there with the biggest games of 2013. Papers, Please is the result of artistic brilliance and will be remembered and celebrated for many years to come.",1,0

It has a story on par with Orwell, but hits a little closer to home, sparking apt comparisons to the TSA's policies. The game has fun, challenging, and unique game play that asks you to make difficult moral choices almost every minute. However as you play it through multiple times for different endings you may find that a few characters feel a little copy pasted. However if you can look past that the game is almost flawless. A unique art style, off beat sound track, stellar story, and one of a kind game play all add up to make Papers, Please a must.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I don't often come across the video-game equivalent of a period film. That might be due to the fact that it's kind of dumb to compare two different mediums based on genre, but I digress.   Papers, Please places you in the role of a border-control worker under a fascist regime in the 1980s that's eerily similar to the Soviet Union. Your job is to inspect the paper work presented by immigrating people and catch discrepancies and/or forgeries. The amount of people you deal with determines your paycheck, which adds a certain degree of urgency to the game. When you're not working, you're also managing your expenses in order to keep your family members healthy and, well, alive. If you make mistakes and turn away or allow people in based on incorrect paper work, you're eventually docked from your pay. The problem is, though, that a lot of the people trying to get into Arstotska have heart-felt stories to tell... and full wallets. You'll be offered bribes from desperate immigrants, your colleagues, and even a rebel group trying to overthrow the government.  This is actually an extremely complex and engrossing game. The amount of paperwork you have to inspect changes entirely or increases as the game progresses. You're constantly learning new ways to inspect for forgeries; non-matching birth dates, weight, issuing city, gender, photos, fingerprints, etc. You learn to be overly-meticulous in your inspections as well as lightning-quick. I actually started to call old ladies names because they were wasting my time with forgeries. I could be dealing with two more people in the time that I'm spending clearing up your discrepancies, you idiot!  Where a lot of other games might force you into the position of a daring hero with the aims to take down authoritarian governments head-on, Papers, Please demonstrates the tension and risk involved with everyday living under a realistic representation of fascism. I can't think of a single other game that tries to be historically accurate as well as give an honest depiction of what life for the bourgeois would be like in this sort of place and time. It's this level of immersion that contributes to a beautifully written narrative and abundance of side stories, as well. The gameplay is the story, and ultimately if you do your job right you come to feel overly invested in the well-being of your family and the people you encounter on the job.   The game plays like a dream, too. I was able to drag everything around my desk and inspect literally every aspect of the paper work without a single lapse in responsiveness, which may have been on account of the pixelly-8bit art style. Like everything else in this game, though, the visuals are purposeful and contribute to the game's bleak atmosphere.  Play Papers, Please! Play it!",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a game you need to play to fully appreciate - screenshots do not do it justice. Think 'hidden object game' crossed with 'time management game' in a depressing Soviet landscape.  It is a truly ingenious puzzle game at it's core and the dreary art style is a perfect fit. You play as a border guard tasked with checking passports and visas and ultimately deciding who gets to enter the country. It eases you into the game gently enough that anyone can play the first few rounds, but it quickly gets devilishly difficult as the rules and regulations for entering the country become more and more complex. Accuracy and speed become factors if you care at all about feeding your family and protecting them from the bitter cold - you could always let them starve or freeze of course...   The game goes so far as to make you face moral dilemmas, it creates a sort of paranoia where you trust no one and even begin to question your own intentions.  Once I started playing, it was really difficult to stop and I would highly recommend trying this game if you like detail oriented puzzle games.

It has an 16-bit graphical type that is really good for it being developed by only on person. But i can't understand where the 2GB Ram needed to play this game come from.

There is a surprising amount of little side stories in the game that is given to you just through interaction with people at your checkpoint window.

Just as the trailer shows you check passports - but it gets progressively harder over the course of time, not to mention interesting. The trailer literally nails what the game is about and does a good job of it. I found myself playing for an hour easily the first time I played. It literally delivers what it is designed to and isn't meant for a person who cannot sit still and analyze the finer details required to meet the games challenge demands. I like it as it forces me to pay attention. There are surprises in the game and nothing works exactly as it's supposed to. You may be offered a bribe half way through the game, and if you take it, you may get away with it. However, you may get caught down the line and then thrown in prison. Subsequently, you must try your best to keep your family alive. Money pays for heat and health needs of the family. Upgrades are also available for the booth, as well as your dwelling. You will run into an assortment of characters (to say the least) that will keep you on your toes.   Graphics are basic. Is this bad? Not at all as the person who did the designs was extremely careful in what they were trying to achieve. Sounds do not have much of a variation, but I guarantee you'll be repeating what the guy on the loud speaker says every time you click it.

But dont let the graphics, the minimalistic gameplay and repetetive music fool you. This game is one of the greatest out there, and easily beats AAA titles. I peaked you interest yet? Good.    You play as a border inspector in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka, just having finished a war against the neighbor country Kolechia that lasted 6 long years. Your job is paperwork. All you do is stamp passports and look through papers. Fisrt day, only citizens of Arstotzka are allowed entry. Next up, foreingers with valid passports are allowed to enter. Same day terrorists attack the border. Next day all foreingers must present a valid entry ticket. It all goes on and on and on. Eventually you will be dealing with a lot of papers. Still, you are expected too keep the same amount of presicion and speed as you had before. Why? At the end of each day you manage your expenses: Heat, food and rent. On top of this, we have your family: Son, wife, mother in law and your uncle. Not paying for food or heat will result in them being sick, which will result in them needing medicine. If you cant pay for medicine, one of your family members die. But on top of that, if you make a mistake at work, you get a citation. First two are warnings, after that you have to pay 5 credits per mistake. Incedentlly, every entrant you procces correctly will give you 5 credits.  Now, with that out of the way, this game has a lot of choices. There is no black and white, there is only gray. This women does not have the right papers, but she will be killed if she returns to her home country. Do you let her in at the expense of your family, or do you deny here and move on? This man carries what he calls 'harmless medicine' and pays you 10 credits to let him pass. Do you detain him, or do you give a stamp?  Do you help a secret group overthrow the proclaimed corrupt goverment? Do you do your thing as a upstanding citizen?  Papers, Please is a work of art. Amazing and fitting gameplay, awesome story and sub stories.  Also, you might wonder what happens when your family dies or you run out of money.

239030,"Papers, Please","I played through this twice for the achievements and to experience both sides of the story, and enjoyed doing so. It's a very interesting.. data management game, for lack of a better term, with quite an interesting storyline that is going on around the player and his little customs box.  Though there are some personally uncomfortable themes in the game, I did not actually get a sense of depression or desperation from playing the game that some others have mentioned, though I can definitely see where that can come from. But once you figure out you can alternate not paying food or heating every other day, and know to avoid a couple early game pitfalls, money really isn't a problem any longer and you're free to follow your morals and eat any penalties, and you'll have enough money to still trivialize the later parts of the game as long as you're not going for both the money-heavy achievements at once. I feel the interaction with the people trying to cross the border could have been written to be much more heartbreaking than it was, though.  One of the shining stars of the game is the branching save system, it saves a new save at the start of each day, linked to the day before it, and if you go back in time and load a save and continue from there, it creates a new save chain that branches out from the old one at the point that you loaded from. The graphics are nowhere near modern, but fit in quite well with the dystopian time period and the feel of the game.  The game really drags you into the plot, a hapless 'lottery winner' set in a world that's parallel to strife-torn eastern Europe from the past, but with city and country names that hint at regions from all around the world. The area is ripped apart by the aftermath and lingering threat of a civil war and tensions between the various countries, and all that plays heavily into your day to day work, constantly throwing you new challenges and twists.

239030,"Papers, Please",It's a very fun game. It takes monotony and finds away to make it fun and you feel invested in what you're doing. You're scanning people's passports for errors using various tools as an immigration officer for a fictional Russian-like country.   For the most part it's pretty stright forward but as time goes on the things you have to look for become more numerous and more subtle raising the difficulty as time goes on. For every day you complete you get money. And with that money you decide which necessities your family can afford. Maybe today they get to eat. Tomarrow they may get some heat in your apartment so they don't freeze to death. Maybe your son needs medication or he won't make it through the night. Rarley will have enough to do everything and if you don't manage your funds it's very likley that some or all of your family will die.  But it's not all just checking passes and hoping your family doesn't die from having their basic needs go unforfilled. There is a bigger story happening and while you're never outright told if you fulfill certain requirements the story will turn down one of a handful of paths.   It's a very interesting game and I highly recommend it.,1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is a game unlike any other. It's unique in a good way. It seems dull, repetitive, and boring, but believe it or not, it's actually FUN. You are an immigration inspector who must see who can and can't pass through the border to Arstotzka, which makes me think of Soviet Russia in many ways. Pretty difficult game to me, since it can be hard finding the fake passports, IDs, etc etc. To add on to this great game, there are lots of humorous and somewhat sad parts. We all know and love Jorji, the most honest immigrant you'll ever find, and also I remember encountering a woman who wanted to see her son that she never saw in 6 years, but I had to not let her pass because I found some issues with her passport. The graphics are great! I can't say a single bad thing about it. TBH I don't even know if there really is a story to this, but that would be hard to do, especially for this type of game. My only flaw is that they could've had some more lore to the game so that way I could learn about Arstotzka and all of the other countries. Also, the endless mode is a bit repetitive, so don't expect much replay value. This is probably one of my favorite indie games right now, and is a special game that pops out from the best.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a very original game, but unfortunately it doesn't reward the time you spend with it. During the first hour or two of playtime it's easy to find yourself immersed in the dystopian fictional world and curious about what will happen next. However, after a while you realize that there is very little variety in terms of the scenarios that present themselves. Assuming you manage to stay on the good side of your superiors, this lack of variety leads to sessions that drag on and on and become extremely tedious.  After reaching the end of any given playthrough there's little point in playing again. The only changes you'll encounter are when you get to choose a slightly different path by allowing somebody's wife through (or not), confiscating a diplomat's passport (or not), and so on. The differences in outcome are minor at best and certainly not worth 30-60 minutes of drudgery as you click through endless piles of documents.  The game's presentation is bare bones, but I think the audio and visual style works well and accomplishes what it sets out to do. The interface is decent, although the small space you have to work with means papers get lost under other ones and lots of annoyance as you go digging for whatever it is you're looking for. The system for finding discrepancies is fairly opaque at first, which will lead to frustration as you wonder how to properly execute your instructions. Even later on this can be an issue at times as the demands you're placed under become more and more complex.  I think Papers, Please is an interesting experiment and worth at least playing around with for a few hours. I'd definitely wait for it to go on sale though. I just don't think most people will find enough enjoyment here to justify paying full price.",-1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","I guess I'm really late to the party. For a long time, I've been hearing this game take a lot of praise -Yahtzee even loved it! So why am I so late to play Papers Please? Well, I kept thinking that it's a morality-driven game, that seeks to soften your heart with emotional shortcuts about NPC strangers and darkside vs lightside choices like we see in so many games (cough...Bioware...cough). Boy, I'm sure glad I was wrong.  Make no mistake, this game has a lot of empathy potential. It paints a dystopian picture of a soviet country in a world region with poor living standards. Lots of people are seeking to enter the borders from other countries around you, be it to flee conflict, to seek work or to have surgery in your country's better-equipped hospitals. You have to manage helping strangers with their implied problems who sometimes don't have their paperwork in order, with not slipping up at work to keep you and your family fed and sheltered. Bonus points if you come from an ex-communist country like me and you know from your parents what it means to live with rationed food and heat in a government-assigned apartment.   However, the game also gives you incentive to play the villain once in a while, and it's sort of fun be be a prick. You're stuck at a clerk's desk doing a monotonous job, and then a guy comes in and insults your son's pencil drawing he lovingly made for you? I'll be sure to comb that jerk's passport for ANY small irregularity. The game likes to play with you quite a bit, small spoiler examples include    the guy who insults your son's drawing is always clean. The guy who admires your family photo is always trying to distract you from something.    Some immigrants can be really lousy people up to no good. It's very satisfying to catch smugglers, abusers or even smug little NPCs like the aforementioned who like to come in your office and give you lip.   If it were only about the morality, though, I wouldn't have played Papers Please so obsessively. The gameplay though is more than satisfying: in late stages, very intricate paperwork requires you to sweat while checking each paper carefully, praying you don't ♥♥♥♥ up a mini quest, then clenching your teeth for a few seconds after you process someone waiting to see if you're getting that dreaded citation for messing up. Most of the narrative is implied instead of spoon-fed and depends on you making mental connections; it's really fun when you catch some little typo in the name of some bloke's hometown that tips you off they forged their passport and are up to no good; or when you notice a lady has 2 extra pounds than it says on her entry permit - you search her and she has drugs strapped beneath her skirt.   Papers Please has a wonderful playful tone very appropriate to a cartoonish satire. Precisely nailing the style of humour of Russian jokes, where people poke fun at heavy themes in a light-hearted stoic manner, the game's dark humour and catoonish estethic (from its delightfully sovietic music to its laconic, stilted English) suit this soviet dystopia masterfully. The game has very little exposition. The longer you play, the more you'll become familiar with the various nations and their particularities, gleaning the geopolitical situation of this fictional area from newspaper articles (that react to your perfomarnce guarding the border) and from dozens of personal stories.   I'm really glad that I bought this game on a whim and I hope I'll get the chance to see more creative gems like Papers Pleaser and to support more devs like Lucas Pope who enrich our experience.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, please.', the name of this game is also that one piece of dialogue you will read over and over and over again. You are an inspector for a communist regime, in a fictional country set in 1982. It is your job to keep the country safe, now that its borders have opened up again (a little). Natives and foreigners alike will have to show you their papers, including passports, ID cards and permits of various sorts and you must check them for credibility. Basically, Papers, Please is a simulation of the actual job of a border guard. Since this is set in a dystopian, cold war-era though, it is far from boring. Security is tight and you cannot afford any mistakes, especially because the life of your own family depends on it. After each day of sieving through papers, you will have to spend your hard-earned salary on rent, food and warmth for your loved ones. This forces you to work fast, though working fast makes you more prone to errors, which in turn might lead to penalties for any mistakes, even those as small as forgetting to check the date of expiration on a worker's permit.  Putting yourself and your family first will mean absolute obedience to your regime, however, and a strict and methological approach to every single one of the (partly random, partly story-related) visitors. Some will tell you sad stories about how much they miss their family, others will flat-out lie to you and it is always up to you if they may enter or not. A psychological experiment, one could say. Will you stand up against a cold government and turn a blind eye on those with no malicious intend or will you be absolutely loyal in order to secure your paycheck for the day?  Playing through the storymode will confront you with various events, setting off chains and affecting the game later on. Apart from this, there are also some endless-gamemodes included, such as endurance (work until you run out of money) or time-trial (finish up as many people as possible within a given time).  Papers, Please is one of the most interesting games out there right now and it does not even need any graphical miracles to pull that off. In fact, the monotone, pixelated world only contributes to its disturbingly grim atmosphere.  What would you do?",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please , which celebrated its 1-year anniversary last week, is described as “a dystopian document thriller” – quite an intriguing mouthful for a game description, but nonetheless a very fitting description for a truly unique game. Heavily influenced by the border systems present during World War II,  Papers, Please  introduces the player to the communist state of Arstotzka, which recently ended a 6-year war with its neighbors and otherwise reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin.  Winning the lottery would be a nice thing – everywhere but in Arstotzka and in Shirley Jackson’s novel. Unlike Jackson’s novel however, the player gets to live after winning the lottery, but they are forced to take the job as an immigration inspector. And without further ado or formal introduction, day one starts and the player has to face foreigners wanting to immigrate and citizens wishing to return – all with both poor and good attempts to cross the border and (re-)enter Arstotzka.  The gameplay appears extremely simple, but as the game progresses and more regulations are added to the border-security and immigration processes, the harder and more complex the game becomes. The player has to ensure details ranging from name, day-of-birth, sex and passport number to appearance, height and work pass’ are in correct order. Should the player fail to do so, more than three times per shift, a penalty is applied which ultimately hits the player hard as they are under a massive pressure to support a wife, mother-in-law, son and uncle with food, heat, medicine and shelter.  This ultimately introduces a great range of moral choices – should the player bend the rules after hearing some visitor’s heartbreaking stories and let them enter; knowing the consequences? A few achievements are in fact challenging the player’s moral stance – for instance, should an aging woman be allowed to visit her son despite having discrepancy in her papers? Similar, as the entry requirements tightens – following the significant increase in terrorist attacks inside Arstotzka against the oppressive government – more people may be detained. The choice, however, ultimately lays with the player – but as the nearby guard continues to declare his willingness to share his payment, which happens to be based on the amount of detains, the more tempted the player becomes. It becomes a simple matter of survival and thus prioritization.  An interesting aspect to Papers, Please is the sound effects, audio and graphics. There are no identifiable voices (in any language), but rather extremely robotic and inhumane voices – something which follows the unidentifiable, gender less and anonymous queue outside the inspector booth. Both elements together with the Kafkaesque, colourless and overall dystopian environment greatly amplifies the alienation between the state and the people.  The lack of human compassion is stunning, but perhaps very fitting for a totalitarian bureaucracy which values the state above everything and everyone. This, once again, introduces the player’s role – no action is inconsequential, and with every coin having two sides nothing is just black and white. Yet the player is ultimately the only one who can question the procedures and do the unexpected and unwanted; show compassion and empathy. The choices will ultimately impact the player’s family directly as illnesses, hunger and cold all follows rapidly though.   Papers, Please  is in truth a unique game which pokes to the player’s moral and human compassion. It introduces the player to a very special and dystopian environment which, if allowed, greatly influences the player. It is not a game for everyone, but those who wishes to find a raw pearl within the ocean of indie-games and for those who treasures great narrative and design, this is the game.

239030,"Papers, Please","11/10  Papers, Please is an indie game that mimics the border control of the Cold War Era Soviet Block. You play the part of a border control officer, checking all the people's papers are intact, and with each day you have something new to look out for like a forged stamp, different wanted criminals and such. You can take many paths (with up to 20 possible endings) but need to be sure to keep your job and support your family at the same time (I managed to kill my son on about the 5th day).  The graphics and visuals of this game are ingenious, with 8-bit, clunky visuals on the top third of your screen and a more smooth, in-view area on the bottom two thirds of your screen to give a sense of realism, like you're really in that booth.  The gameplay has the potential to be very boring, with the repetitive task of checking people's papers everyday, but the fact that you never know what's going to happen is the beauty of the game. Will a terrorist attack the guards, will a wanted criminal walk into the booth? This one lady insulted my plaque. I was proud of that ♥♥♥♥ing plaque, the ♥♥♥♥♥.

239030,"Papers, Please","Everyday I walked to work, my eyes on the cold grey and lifeless ground to an even bleaker work environment. I feign a weak smile and say hello to the guard everyday but on the days he doesn't regard me, he looks at me as if he was looking at the void on the horizon. Then he lights up a cheap cigarette he got from the commissary.   Life is grey and sad and blue. The people are never happy except for one curious fellow. Some have stories that kill my soul more and more each day when I have to reject their entry. But I have a family to feed. Others are allowed in, but they are ♥♥♥♥♥s. They offer me comfort.  But I have a family to feed.  One day, I snap. A man's ID says he's a woman and was born 2 weeks in the future. I let him in. A foreign menace requests entry, I let him in. A war criminal doesn't even have papers. I let him in. The guards look at me quizzically after the 6th person in a row. I'm losing my pay, but it doesn't matter.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is a great game. It's basically a game where you control a checkpoint at the edge of a country and you can decide whether people are let in or not. Simple, right?  Well, if it was THAT simple, it probably wouldn't even be on Steam.  The country you work for, Artzstotska (I bet I spelled that incorrectly) apparently has a lot of issues, and it gets to the point where billions of documents have to be checked before you can clear them for entry. One tiny mess-up, and you can get fined, warned, or worse. And at the end of the day, the money you make is immediately spent for your family so that you and your family can stay alive. I actually found myself really concerned about my family while I was playing this game and felt overwhelemed as if I was actually a poor man not doing so well in a communist country.  Also, I'm not very good, because my uncle, wife, and son died :(  That would STILL be boring if it wasn't for the immense variety of people that come in. Some are smugglers, some are reporters that I can't let through, some don't have the right papers but beg and bribe me, some have stories, some cuss at me, some threaten me, and some launch terrorist attacks. Personally, I'll let anyone in that will bribe me enough to compensate for my violation fees, and detain anyone because I made a deal with a security guard to have half of his bonus whenever I detain a person with him. I am now trained to use a gun to deal with attackers, and I am a very good shooter. Secretly though, I am part of a special underground operation that aims to take down the horrible government and I recieve messages from them every day.  This game has a lot to offer.

The player receives money based on performance to pay for amenities at home, then the next day begins.   The nation’s immigrations policy changes, and so do the people you service; the stories are told from the glimpses of a small border entry. You, the player, the insignificant being of the grand scheme of things, play a cog in the clockwork that this game has created. Your seemingly insignificant choices influence the multiple families and organizations through a simple choice between red or green stamp.    This game is not for everyone.

I remember when he told me about it: 'You are a border inspector and you decide wether you let people into the country, or not.' How could that possibly be fun.

This is has to be one of the most unique and perfectly polished games I've ever tried.

When I accepted a bribe from a criminal to pay for my dying son's medecine.   Papers, Please manages to make a worker's mundane day to day job into a tense, almost stressful, life and death situation (literally, I've died three times).  Somehow I don't think this game would work with non-pixelated graphics. The music and the bleak color palette of greys and browns make me feel like I actually speak russian.  You check fingerprints, strip search, arrest, interrogate; all the things you never even knew you really, really wanted to do. Is the fact that you can help those in need? Punish criminals or normal people just because the said something that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off? Is it the power that makes me want to keep playing? Probably. I'm not sure.

I've got a good memory and detail for spotting errors, and even then I messed up so often in this game that it got rather embarassing. But I did get to the end, and got all the achievements. So even my utter failure at being a border inspector managed to be ok in the end.  So if it's not fun to play, why is this a 'yes' recommendation? Atmosphere. The lack of fun adds to that, oddly enough, and what you get is a game where you feel like a bureaucrat working for a pseudo facist/communist government that pays you crumbs and is all too ready to throw you in jail. The whole game dips you into this unpleasant world and does not let you escape unless you beat it or quit the game.  So it's an unfun game that uses that to add to the game's superbly done setting. If nothing else, it's often a very cheap game so you won't lose much money buying it. I'd say its worth checking out, if only to see what the fuss is about and to be the jackass government employee you always wanted to be... for only a few hours.  Glory to... no. That place sucks.

239030,"Papers, Please","Glory To Arstotzka.  Papers, Please is a truly remarkable little game created by a single man, Lucas Pope, who has previously created many freeware titles with a similar look and feel to them. Papers, Please has you being randomly chosen as the chief inspector of the newly opened border to the  oppressive and corrupt  glorious country of Arstotszka, your family has been moved to a class-8 settlement and you will need to balance how quickly you get people through your border with making sure that you are only letting through people with 100% valid paperwork to get paid and to support your family so they don't die cold, hungry, and sick. Which seems easy enough, but as the border becomes more and more strict and as the game adds more and more rules to watch out for it can become quite the challange which requires a lot of observation to do your job right. Alongside this, the game will offer a lot of moral dilemmas of desperate people who want into your country who  you can approve, but would suffer a penalty for doing so.  you shall not approve under any circumstance unless they have the correct paperwork.  The game's story is told very behind-the-scenes and you might not even notice how expansive the story is until the end of your first playthough, with the game having twenty different endings to get to depending on the choices you make and the people you do and don't let through. The game, like some other games of Pope's, seeks to make a political statement about security, violation of privacy and rights, and unjust censorship.  This game is in no ways pretty, the look is dark and dystopian, and the world barely has any color in it, but it's all made this way to help suit the style of the game and also to not blind the player with too much information. It allows you to easily see if a picture is false and if there is something wrong about someone's papers, such as a forged seal.  Overall, the game is very good at what it does and I believe that it actually is worth the ten dollar price tag, as it has a lot of replayability to see the different endings, and the game also has an endless mode. Frankly, there is so much more I could talk about in this game and why it's genius but it would spoil much of the experience, it's really a game that you have to play for yourself.

As to your family: you make a certain amount of credits each day based on how many people you correctly allowed to immigrate. Each day the rules get a little harder. Each day you make a little less.

That’s pretty much the basis of Papers, Please. You check passports and paperwork to allow people into Arstotzka. You need to earn enough money to support your family. But all that info does no good if we can’t play it. So, how’s accessibility?  I can’t explain how excited I was to see this. You can get windowed mode before you even open the game. Thank you developers! Windowed mode is borderless so you can access your desktop with ease. Onscreen Keyboard was a click away but honestly wasn’t needed in the first look. So far the game is pretty point and click. I haven’t found a way to control gameplay with the keyboard alone, but will keep trying and will definitely report back if a solution is found. Colorblind mode is also nowhere to be found.  So far Papers, Please has been a joy for mouse only players. The first level took nothing more than point and click or drag and drop mechanics.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please accomplishes something many would consider impossible.  It takes a completely mundane, boring job, makes a game about it, and makes it fun.   Seriously, imagine some pitching the following idea to you.  'How about a game where you play a customs officer? People come into your office on the country border, hand you their passport and other documents, and you check to make sure everything is in order.'  If you are a publisher, you would stop listening to that person. If you aren't a publisher, you would still probably think it's a bad idea.  The thing is, though, that's exactly what the game is,  and it's still fun to play.  Even more mind-bogglingly,  it's fun to play through two or three times .  What makes this possible is the scenario. You work the border of a communist country that's clearly supposed to be a rip-off of Russia. (At least that's my interpretation. There are apparently several other valid possibilities, but it's clear that every country is ripping off some real country.) This is the job the government has assigned to you. Said government doesn't take ♥♥♥♥ from slackers, so rather than pay you by the hour, they pay you by the person. You have to provide for you and your family though, so the faster you work, the better the pay. That is, unless you start screwing up. If you let someone in that had bad papers, or deny someone with good papers, you get paid nothing, and also get docked pay for each mistake past the first. This alone creates a tension; work too fast, and you get screwed by mistakes, but work too slow, and you get screwed by inadequete pay.  On top of this, there are several unique characters that visit you every day. Many of them can be described as 'I know my papers aren't in order but pleasepleaseplease let me in.' For example, a husband with good papers asks you to let his wife in, who's next in line, but missing a critical paper. Do you take pity and let her in, or stick to your job and separate them?  There is a lot going on; the game reacts to your choices in a very natural way. Did you catch a wanted criminal trying to get through customs? The newspaper headline tomorrow will exclaim 'Criminal caught in customs!'  There are too many examples to list, especially when several of them will spoil key elements of the game.  Trust me. Just buy this game. It's worth the price tag. I know the concept is a hard sell, but you will NOT be disappointed.",1,1

Especially if you like to try your hand at beurocratic tasks in a video game in an exciting way. It's monotonous, but enjoyable. I know it's less than 20 hours to get 100%, but I logged in (at the time of this writing) at least 43 hours of gameplay. It's that good.  You play as an unknown inspector who was elected through a lottery to work   as a security guard running a graveyard shift at Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria for 5 nights  as a border inspector between the cursed Kolechia and the wonderous motherland Arstotzka for one month. But you have a time limit in which you can work, which adds pressure to your performance. Inspect more and provide the correct responses quickly to get paid more. Make mistakes and it'll come out of your paycheck after 2 free warnings a day. By the end of the day, you'll need to pay for rent, food (optional), heat (optional), medical bills (optional if heat or food is neglected), and various other opportunities. You play as a father providing for your family. If your family dies (or other conditions occur), the game is over. It's also a plus that it throws in ethical dillemas to keep you on your toes.  People say this game is communistic and I'd say I agree with their statements. You are playing in a job you did not choose and are dissuaded from trying to make more than you actually do...which makes it understandable why people would take bribes in communistic or socialist countries.  There are various paths you can take to different endings. You can choose to complete your tasks in a purely beaurocratic manner for the motherland Arstotzka, you can help aid in a revolution for the Order of the EZIC Star, or you can escape Arstotzka by moving away with forged passports. The fate of the people, the nation, and your family are in your hands.   PROS: Addicting gameplay Great (yet simple) story Great challenges Nice Puzzles (if you choose to work for EZIC) Implementation of ethical dillemas No bugs Randomized portraits and stats based on a database (great programming) Arstotzka (Joke pro. XD)  CONS: Limited music choices No planned sequel at this point Can be infuriating if you make mistakes Not all moral/ethical choices are judged/rewarded May be too bland/boring/monotonous to some (Not for me, but there are times where it can feel dull) Kolechia (Okay, that's a joke con. Just making sure you're reading these. lol)   This game is a great experience that seems simplistic, yet is so much more. You can lose yourself for hours at a time playing this game. I cannot say whether or not it's worth full price, but if it is on sale, you would have to be crazy to not grab it.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please was first introduced to me in Alpha, and it was already great. I followed it through development and into Steam, where it got bigger and better.   The constant being on-edge, management, strategy and difficulties you face are balanced by a wonderful simplistic art style and great soundtrack. The interface is perhaps a little counter-intuitive at points for me, but that's really my only problem with it. Given the number of endings, its replay value is immense. Even today after [insert large number here] hours of gameplay, I'm finding new things to do, new things I like doing in the game.  The best part is the waiting, which makes no sense without context. After you approve an applicant, there's the little tense wait to see if you got a citation. You begin to hate the little *clickity click* sound of the citation appearing, and makes you get angry at the system. You want revenge, and EZIC are there to help. Personally, I've always gone against EZIC, but the game adapts to your playstyle, once you adapt to it.   The best kind of game is one that impacts upon the player and vice versa.

239030,"Papers, Please","My job is dull, repetitive, and boring. Every day its the same crap over and over. They keep adding new documents and files that the miserable immigrants have to bring to get in, which of course means more work for me. I remember when i took pity on these pathetic immigrants. I would listen to their endless sob stories and even let a few slip by without the required paperwork. But not anymore. I've grown to hate them. The only thing worse than this hell of a job , is having to return home to my family. There is never enough. Someone is always sick or hungry. Everyone is cold and unhappy. I'm afraid i've grown to hate them as well. To top it all off things are only getting worse. Nights are getting colder, we loose people, the job gets harder, acts of terrorism cause lock downs that do nothing but waste my time. I watched a co-worker get blown to pieces by a 'freedom fighter' yesterday and it didnt even faze me. Im just waiting for death. Of my family, of this country, of these immigrants. or of me. Wasnt there a point of happiness in my life? Before my son was born, when me and the wife were first married. Before this country had gone to hell and the with it the world...

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please has to be the most interesting bureaucratic sim game out there. I know that sounds like damning with faint praise, but I seriously enjoy this game.  As a citizen of the country Arstotzka, you've been chosen by way of the job lottery to work on the newly reopened border, making sure anyone that wants to get in has the correct papers. The rules change almost daily (for example, on day one, you can only allow native Arstotzkans back in, but on day two, you start admitting in foreigners as well) and your pay is connected to how many people you correctly process during the set work hours. If you get too many citations for incorrect processing, your paycheck will start to be penalized and it will become more difficult to pay for you and your family's rent and utilities.  It's up to you if you follow the rules completely or allow a few people to squeak by once in a while, whether they're a couple trying to flee their old country but only one of them has correct paperwork or whether they're dissenters against the Arstotzkan government. Some people will even offer you some very tempting bribes that could be worth it for you and your family.  On occasion, it can be frustrating to miss something as small as an incorrect expiration date or stamp and get a warning citation for it, but it's still an addictingly fun and interesting game. The graphics have a very old-school DOS look to them that fits the 80's dystopian tone the game is going for. There's also an Easy Mode setting for any newcomers that are a bit nervous about their pacing in checking people's papers; it's a good training wheels option to start with and you can still get achievements in it. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun indie game with a little political intrigue, spotting differences while on the clock, some interesting moral choices, and multiple endings.",1,0

It's once more a demonstration that, even with 2D graphics, a game can be overwhelmingly enjoyable and at the same time demanding as Hell.   Even if you think that you are watching out for every detail to be correct, you might just make a small mistake. And if it's just the sex entered in the papers which is wrong, you will find that the slightest mistake can result in a warning from your higher ups. And even if you aren't that far into the game, it can become a little confusing with how much you need to watch out for. Is the date correct? Does the person in question have a valid ticket / permission to enter? Is the passport real or forged? Which ethnic groups are allowed in, which aren't? And are there potential terrorists amongst those of a certain nationality?  I only just begun scraping at the surface of this great game, and I'm already hooked.

The concept is very simple: You regulate the borders of a make believe country called Arstotska and you approve or deny immigrates passage, depending on the rules of the day. However as you progress the story unfolds to something more complex, maybe even emotional. Throughout your work you discover people and their stories, which can have a deep impact. E.g. an immigrant hasn't seen her son in six years but has expired documents. Do you deny her entry? Or do you let her through and face disciplinary action from your superiors?

239030,"Papers, Please","Who'd have thought checking paperwork could be so fun?  Labelled as a dystopian document thriller, 'Papers, Please' sees you trying to support your family as you check and punch paperwork on the border to the fictional country of Arstotzka. Checking date-of-birth and ID numbers match, asking for tickets and work permits, checking thumbprints and keeping an eye out for reported criminals, your list of tasks grows day by day and the opportunities for deceit begin to pile up. Just as you get used to the system, someone throws a molotov across the border and new, tighter regulations get introduced.  The game is fantastic in how it presents itself, the story and gameplay are seamlessly integrated, and you face tough moral decisions and questionable actions. Do you let a man's wife pass into the country with her clearly forged passport? Do you detain someone smuggling in medicine for her own family? When you're struggling to pay the bills and your wife and son are sick, do you take the bribe pushed your way? The game is generally bleak, although offset with a quirky charm, and it is always interesting.  New twists to your expected procedures are frequent, and the citizens you deal with range from terse to vibrant. There are multiple endings, most of them grim, but there's the opportunity to replay the start of any day with a fantastic branching save system.  Thoroughly recommended. Glory to Arstotzka.

239030,"Papers, Please","In a world where many people don't realize a 'visa' isn't always a credit card, Papers Please seems like a pretty odd concept. A game where you stamp passports, being careful to abide by the ever-increasing rules and regulations of your dystopian public employers that are subject to the hopeless political climate of your war-torn and espionage-filled region, tends to stand out amongst the current plethora of green-lit retro platformers.   Despite my own life-long love for a good sidescroller, I have to say Papers Please is the most engrossed I've been in a game in quite a while. When you're not lost in the bureaucratic fever dream of scanning each and every entrant's documentation - of which more and more will be required as time goes on and governments play dirtier - you're juggling funds for your family's food, heat, medicine, and possibility of moving up from the 'Class-8' dwellings that sound only a notch better than homelessness.   What's more, it comes as no surprise that those around you are looking to do the same; almost each day of the game has someone with missing or faulty documentation and an excuse to go along with it. Reuniting two long-lost loves, aiding an underground resistance group, allowing a woman on death-row in her home country with no documentation to enter with her allowed husband, allowing a child serial killer in (rather than detaining him) so a vengeful father of a little girl can exercise his own justice, and the repeated attempts of a happy-go-lucky drug dealer who tries entering with a crayon passport are all decisions left up to you, keeping in mind the 2-citation limit you get per day before being docked much-needed pay.  And honestly, when you see a citation pop up that wasn't on purpose, that ♥♥♥♥ing fax-machine sound and a pink slip popping up? Your heart ♥♥♥♥ing sinks. You feel like an idiot. And worst of all, who knows what sort of scumbag you just let into the country scot-free after a long day of rejecting numerous people whose intentions and needs were possibly far more innocent than their lack of documents would suggest.   Still, the game has its faults. 'Booth upgrades' are simple hotkeys to make your job a smidge faster that many seem to not want to use anyway. The sound leaves a lot to be desired - there's basically 3 gibberish-y voice lines that are reused throughout each line of dialog ('baebaz', 'hiyakku', 'oushtod'), the game has a nearly overwhelming amount of endings (many of which feel more like a depressing Game-Over than an ending), and some things like the benefits of upgrading your apartment are poorly explained.  But play this game, and be mindful about it. Don't fall into the the ♥♥♥♥ing 'Glory to Arstotzka!' memespouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, don't treat it like Dystopian Despot Simulator XDDD 2013 and then toss it away without trying the other playstyles, and think about how immigration, customs, and bureaucracy affect you and all those in the world for better or worse, right down to the individual working at the desk.",1,1

Because of this, there are only two games other than this one that I consider 'art', Shadow of the Colossus and Limbo. But SotC and Limbo both have similar atmospheres and worlds, something that Papers Please doesn't bother trying to set up to the same extent.  Papers Please works instead as the videogame equivalent to Albert Camus's 'The Stranger', in that you have to choose what is morally right and logically right. There's no real answer to any of the major border holdups you encounter throughout the game. By supporting a totalitarian regime you help secure your family's safety, but at the price of the immigrants and revolutionaries crossing the border. By helping the underground resistance movements, you put yourself and your entire family at risk, without the closure of knowing you became a martyr for a bigger cause.  So there's the holdup. Do you go with what is ethically right, appealing to your emotions to do what's best in the grand scheme of things?

Although the game's heart is at its story, it still has functional and enjoyable gameplay, which continues to refreshen itself on each progressive day. The lack of music within the work day is at times annoying, but overall adds to the dull, monotonous and monochrome environment the game tries to enforce. It also becomes fidgety at sometimes with certain instances, where I felt I was unfairly penalized for following the instructions as written. Nonetheless, it is still an exciting indie title that breaks the mold and gives off unique vibes.  Overall, the game is a truly one of a kind experience and should not be passed up by anyone who enjoys a compelling story.

Either you're intrigued by the concept, curious just how they can manage to make such a boring idea into compelling action, or you're instantly repelled by the premise, and rightfully so. This is about as indie as indie games get, and also as brilliant as they get. It takes such a simple thing, and wraps it up in politics, real-world parallels, and perhaps even some genuine feels to make you feel more invested in the fate of a fictional immigration officer than you ever would about a generic grimacing action hero.   But drama and intelligence aside, it's also surprisingly fun, with a very smooth difficulty curve that makes you feel your own skills improving just enough to meet the game's increasing demands. It even comes with some bonus high score modes that you could conceivably see yourself playing.

While intensly working on checking data from the papers, you always have to be ready for a terrorist attack or some other event which may come unexpected. I also especially like the moral choices (which do not have influence on the story), for example, will you accept the wife to get to her husband even though she doesnt't have correct data? Will you accept bribes for people with not enough money to get the needed papers? Then there are bigger decisions that may change the complete story of the game, which I will not give an example for, because they might contain big spoilers.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a very strange and difficult to rate game. You are an immigration officer, charged with determining who to let into the fictional Eastern European communist country of Arstotzka. Even the genre of the game is rather hard to pin down; ultimately, the game boils down to trying to find inconsistencies in the papers, making it a puzzle game of sorts, but it somehow lends checking people’s paperwork an air of great gravity and tension, even if the actual activity itself is rather boring.  I don’t know if you can really say that Papers, Please is a fun game; there is a great feeling of tension throughout, and yet also of monotony. Somehow, you feel obligated to keep your faceless family members alive; somehow, you feel like the question of a bribe is a real one that has real weight; somehow, you feel like what you’re doing is important. And yet, ultimately, you’re just checking paperwork and determining whether or not to let people through based on the paperwork and your own feelings about the situation.

239030,"Papers, Please","Once again, another staggeringly unique title is pulled out of the seemingly endless hat of indie game concepts. This time in the form of a disturbingly farmiliar dystopian society known as Arstotzka. While it may seem like the monotonous, dull drone of endlessly stamping passports; Papers, Please is a game of moral conflict. In the world of Papers, Please, you play as an unnamed protagonist, a mid level beaurocrat, working in a border checkpoint that seems like a parallel to East and West Berlin in the 80s. We can only assume these countries are roughly based on the Soviet Union or other Soviet influenced republics. The graphic style has an appropriately grey and muddled appearance that fits the situation very well. The gameplay is deliberately dull, which may be difficult for some to appreciate. As you go down the line, you begin to work in a rhythm. As you gain this rhythm you have satisfaction for catching frauds and it becomes fun in a droning, dull way. Later into the game you may look up, horrified, and realized that you have become a cog in the machine. You have begun processing people and are shocked with how you can dehumanize them in such a way. Sometimes you want to help others, but your family is still barely hovering above the poverty line. How can you keep them alive without accepting bribes or perhaps sending a poor traveller back to their home country where they will die because they do not have the correct papers?

Whether helping take down the government by letting terrorists through, letting people take vigiliante justice, denying people entry even though they may be executed if they return to their home country, or personally killing people to provide for your family. This is not 'Passport Control Simulator.' In this game, you really have to pay attention, and it is good for your brain, because you have to juggle multiple documents at the same time and remember dates and so forth off the top of your head on the fly.

Now that I've finally played for some hours, I have to admit my first reaction to the game idea couldn't have been much farther from the mark. The background story is quite grim, having been influenced by the not so distant history, and this brings unforeseen depth to the game. However, humor is present as well, in the myriad funny details, cultural references, and indeed, the somewhat sparse unique characters. Even the cumbersome old smuggler who kept wasting my valuable inspector-time made me smile every time he trotted in front of the desk and started rambling cheerfully. The mechanic is quite ingenious in that it forces the player to make difficult choices: for instance, is it better to buy the essential supplies that are needed for the family to survive, or upgrades to the inspector's gear that, in the long run, enable the player to gain more money with which to secure their family's well-being? Choices that at first seem good investments in the future may turn out to be little more than shortcuts to an early grave, since a certain amount of randomness in the game's events ensures that each decision the player makes is laden with uncertainty. The carefully balanced mix of random and scripted events effectively create an addictive feeling that the player's actions have real consequences for the player's character and other characters as well.

The have a well developed gameplay unlike the graphs that for being unnecessarily reduced often causes confusion. At the beginning of the game you have a low speed and limited options, however these options can be improved over the course of your career, the game also has multiple endings which makes it really challenging . The main idea of this game is simple, ' how fast is your ability to handle a huge amount of information and answer yes or no ' this idea (I believe) is innovative and beautifully crafted in this game personally believe that this game had been created during an older generation it would be considered a classic for its difficulty.  Pros : - Smart. - Creative. - Funny. - Different finals. - Challenger  Cons : - Graphics unnecessarily limited. - The library ( Book / Manual ) is unnecessarily slow. - The oscillation of your disambiguation options is irritant .  My Grade: 89/100  Inovador e com piadas de gênero político, esse jogo consegue passar a sensação de como seria 'ou era' trabalhar na alfandega de um país da 'cortina de ferro'. O jogo possui uma jogabilidade muito bem trabalhada diferentemente dos gráficos que por serem desnecessariamente reduzidos muitas vezes causa confusão. No inicio do jogo você possui uma agilidade reduzida e opções limitadas, porem estes quesitos são aprimorados ao decorrer da sua carreira, o jogo também possui diversos finais o que o torna desafiador. A principal ideia desse jogo é simples, 'o quão rápido é a sua capacidade de processar uma quantidade enorme de informações e responder sim ou não' essa ideia é (acredito ser) inovadora e muito bem trabalhada neste jogo, pessoalmente acredito que se esse jogo tivesse sido criado durante a geração mais antiga ele seria considerado um clássico pela sua dificuldade.   Pros: -Inteligente. -Criativo. -Engraçado. -Diferentes finais. -Desafiador  Contras: -Gráficos desnecessariamente limitados. -A biblioteca(Manual/ Manual) é desnecessariamente lenta. -A oscilação das sua opções de desambiguidade é irritante.

239030,"Papers, Please","In Papers, Please, you play as the newly-installed border agent for the fictional dystopian country of Arstotzka. Reviewing passports, forms, tickets, permits, scans, fingerprints, ID cards, and vaccination records against an increasingly complex and daily-changing set of rules, you are the judge of whether each newcomer is granted entry, turned away, detained, or even shot.  Sandwiched among the ordinary visitors, travelers, immigrants, asylum seekers, and diplomats, you encounter characters whose future rely on your discretion. These encounters range from the humorous to the heartwrenching, and you have to decide whether to adhere to your guidelines or your sense of right and wrong, whether you're better off taking a bribe or accepting your piecework pay. Some of these decisions have gameplay consequences, while others are merely matters of conscience. Meanwhile, your ability to pay for your family's basic needs rests upon your ability to quickly and accurately process the line of faces waiting in front of you each day. To me, these encounters and decisions were the most compelling part of the game. The player is able to make interesting and consequential choices and either advance or hinder an underground rebellion movement, as well as the lives of individual people.  Most of the time, though, you're just processing paperwork, and that's about as interesting as you would expect. The game does a good job of simulating the inanity and tedium of comparing item after item against rule after rule, checking for discrepancies; of pulling out the 'DENIED' stamp, aligning the passport under it, pressing down upon the stamp, putting the stamp away again, and handing each piece of paper back to its owner. If you like details a lot, are a bit OCD, or enjoy spot-the-difference games, this might become curiously addictive for you, but even as I compulsively continued to stamp paperwork, I experienced a nagging sense that what I was doing felt more like work than fun. I played through the story mode twice for the achievements, and although I was much better at processing the paperwork the second time around, I also found myself thinking about how many game days were still coming with an odd sense of dread. The first time around, there was at least the tension of whether I'd be able to make it through the full month and get to the end of the story (on my very first try, I reached the ending where you run out of money very early on), but on my repeat playthrough, I felt like I had to go through a great deal of tedium to reach the few meaningful encounters that I was interested in experiencing again, differently.  The game does feature several different 'endless' modes, complete with leaderboards, but I see very little incentive to play them, since for me they remove the best parts of the game and keep the most dull. But if processing an infinite line of passports holds appeal for you, that option is available.  One final note: the save system in Papers, Please is excellent. It uses a branching system that allows you to start from the beginning of any game day in any of your previous playthroughs and continue from there, making going back for achievements or to see alternate endings much easier than it might otherwise have been.  Overall, I'd recommend this game for its unique concept, quirky humor, evocative decision-making, and immersive ambience. The story is worth seeing through to a few of its 20 possible endings -- but probably not all of them. Keep in mind, however compelling this game is, it's still a simulation about paperwork.",1,0

Granted the graphics don't look like much but what it lacks in Hi-res PhysX it makes up for in atmosphere, tension, gameplay and consequence, in abundance. (I rather think the graphics and audio are matched perfectly and harmonise each other well) It took me a two or three levels to fully understand how this game plays. (Essentially a spot the difference) But it is so much more than that. It places you in a dead end job with ever changing rule &amp; regulations thrown upon you. But it thrusts completely grey area moral choices at you, interesting people and events.  It has a large amount of replayability. Truly earned it's place as one of my most favourite games.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a very strange and difficult to rate game. You are an immigration officer, charged with determining who to let into the fictional Eastern European communist country of Arstotzka. Even the genre of the game is rather hard to pin down; ultimately, the game boils down to trying to find inconsistencies in the papers, making it a puzzle game of sorts, but it somehow lends checking people’s paperwork an air of great gravity and tension, even if the actual activity itself is rather boring.  I don’t know if you can really say that Papers, Please is a fun game; there is a great feeling of tension throughout, and yet also of monotony. Somehow, you feel obligated to keep your faceless family members alive; somehow, you feel like the question of a bribe is a real one that has real weight; somehow, you feel like what you’re doing is important. And yet, ultimately, you’re just checking paperwork and determining whether or not to let people through based on the paperwork and your own feelings about the situation.  It is definitely an engaging experience, but I'm not sure if I can really say that I had fun playing it, apart from the interactions with Jorji and the tasks I did for EZIC.

There are no points, and winning or losing isn't as black-and-white as you may be used to. You could categorize it as a bureaucracy simulator or an everyday survival game, and that wouldn't necessarily be wrong, but it would definitely miss the point. 'Papers, Please' is — at its heart — an adventure game.  Though everything takes place from within a tiny border checkpoint, the game's drama and tension all comes from the decisions you're forced to make. You'll never feel more anxious stamping a piece of virtual paper than you will when playing this game. You will legitimately hate your supervisor, and you might even care about the people who pass through your little booth.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a very interesting game. The depressive world and story mixed with that intense music, a game i've never played before. It's very difficult and challenging, it requires all your concentration to not miss a tiny detail on any of the given papers; this game is for open-minded people who like very challenging, brain straining games. I really enjoyed the flow of the game, and loved the story changing characters, which appear ever so often, as well as all the other little details put in it. While intensly working on checking data from the papers, you always have to be ready for a terrorist attack or some other event which may come unexpected. I also especially like the moral choices (which do not have influence on the story), for example, will you accept the wife to get to her husband even though she doesnt't have correct data? Will you accept bribes for people with not enough money to get the needed papers? Then there are bigger decisions that may change the complete story of the game, which I will not give an example for, because they might contain big spoilers.

239030,"Papers, Please","On paper, (no pun intended), this game has a pretty boring premise. See how much mind-numbing paperwork you can process in a day to make ends meet. It sounds like a level of enjoyment that can be achieved through the use of Microsft Excel. However, clever storytelling, surprising character development and a difficulty curve that increases as the layers of beaurocracy stack up, make this game intriguing and surprisingly addictive.  It is 1982 in a fictional slice of Eastern Europe. The player becomes a border control inspector in the nightmare totalitarian state of Arstotzka, turning away impoverish families into the cold because their visas are a few weeks out of date. Or maybe you want to play the good guy and let a few desperate people slip through the net? But you also have a family to feed, and in this communist society, your salary is paid based on how many people you process correctly in a day. Too many citations and you’ll be the one left out in the cold.  The simplistic graphics of this game are more than just nostalgia. They add to the impact when something shocking and unexpected happens. Like that guy with shifty-looking eyes strutting out of the ticket booth and shouting ‘GLORY TO KOLECHIA’, shortly before blowing himself up and redecorating the wall with the innards of your security guards.  Your moral choices can alter the stormy political atmosphere, re-unite friends and lovers and deliver justice in any way you see fit. For people don't just live in the country. They ARE the country. I think my only complaint about the game is that it feels dry, sinister and clinical. I know that it was designed to be this way, but it means I can't play for any more than a few minutes before I just feel ... dirty inside ... and want to play something brighter, more colourful and happy.

239030,"Papers, Please","Lucas Pope's Paper's Please is an oddity, in that it's a 'Dystopian Document Thriller'. Reminiscent of Orwell's 1984, Papers Please takes place in Arstotzka, a fictional country that resembles an Eastern European country during the Cold War. Here in Arstotzka, you are a border checkpoint officer, looking over the passports and documents of all citizens attempting to cross into glorious Arstotzka, making sure they have all proper paperwork, whilst also making sure you family doesnt starve to death or get sick.  Whilst this seems like it would make for a boring game, Papers Please is probably one of the tensest games i've played. It riddles you with moral choices, decisions that affect your future (and that of your family), and the stress of taking care of 5/6 individuals, being paid based on your performance. You have to decide if you are going to let you're family go hungry so that you can help you co-workers, or maybe not have any heating, in exchange for letting in one too many people whose stories touched you. Maybe you'll find yourself aiding a terrorist organisation, or even a vengeful father. Or perhaps you will stay a hardworking, productive member of Arstotzka, with all which that entails.  Papers Please is an excellent game, with unique gameplay, hard moral decisions, a large amount of replayability and a fantastic audiovisual aesthetic. It is truly unique, and definitely a game that everyone needs to play.   Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a punishing puzzle with an inventive story, told in a unique manner.  Hopefully that didn't scare you off. It's clear that this is an indie game; most big publishers  would  be scared off by the game's punishing yet fundamentally repetitive gameplay. However, anyone who enjoys brainteasers and an excellent story will be impressed with Papers, Please.  The game, which takes place in an Arstotzkan border checkpoint at East Grestin, is based on sorting through papers. Does this person have all required papers? Are the papers valid? Does anything about the documents conflict with something else? These, and other new complexities, are difficult to understand at a glance, so game difficulty is no problem (though I haven't tried the Easy Mode yet). New twists, often caused by events at your own checkpoint (Kolechians are temporarily forbidden from entering Arstotzka following a Kolechian terrorist attack), are introduced, and often moral dilemmas arise, as bribes, anti-government rebel agents, and star-crossed lovers (Ooh-la-la) are frequent occurences on this border. Money troubles also appear, as you must maintain your family of four (fun things like 'Your wife, uncle, and son died' are treated with little fanfare).  The depth of the story (which has 20 endings) is (quite) deep. The unique method of storytelling, where you see just a snapshot of the lives of travelers, is enough to recommend the game on. The gameplay is interesting, but loses much of its appeal early on. For one to look at this as an incredibly difficult and intense virtual novel would be a good summary, and if you enjoy those types of things, then this could be one of your favorite new indie titles. For gameplay first, story second players, the game is likely to bore you, as the story is the real selling point here.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I'm so conflicted... I love this game, even though it makes me feel very depressed/apprehensive about things.

Really, no other media has that level of interaction (movies, books, comics, theater, music). What makes this game special is that through its mechanics and gameplay, the story unfolds.

The graphics and gameplay are incredibly drab and monotonous, yet there are many well developed underlying story arcs, truly difficult moral choices, and an ever present sense of oppression that gives this game a unique and amazing feel all its own, and makes it hard to walk away from until you see it through to one of its many (usually grim, or at best, bittersweet) endings.  This is a tough game to describe and sell to friends, because at its core, it's a paper-pushing bureaucracy simulator with pixelated graphics and a depressing mood, but it is so, so much more than that (trust me!).

239030,"Papers, Please","Frankly, this game is masterfully done. The idea is original, the graphics fit the claustrophobic and choking atmosphere, the music enhances the idea of a smothering government regime in which the player finds himself as both citizen and employee, and the stories told through the window of your booth are engaging and develop themselves with intrigue and secrecy. It's hard to find where this game could be improved. It's something that works so well as a game, and as an educational experience that it could almost be used in a teaching environment. The idea that a citizen of this government would be placed into the position they are, allowing or denying various people access to their country, seeing the amount of paperwork involved, watching the rules and regulations pile up and change over the course of time leading to frustration, being faced with the moral dilemmas asked of them, and deciding how to handle their allegiance to country versus their conscious and compassion for other human beings is something that truly isn't captured as well as it is here with Papers, Please.   I will say that the game is so well done, that it actually feels like work after awhile, which cuts into the fun factor, though it enchances the simulation aspect. It's almost hard to qualify it into a genre. The mechanics are crisp and clean, they build on themselves day after day, slowly increasing the difficulty by usually adding one or two additional rules, and eventually the player will find that they are totally immersed in the experience. It does feel like work after awhile though, so some players may actually be glad to 'punch out' after an hour or two of game play.  This is a game that has left me thinking about it long after I exit the program. It's something that reaches a state where it's actually more than a game, it's a slice of actual human life.   This falls into the same category as This War of Mine in that it's an important game, and one that people should play with more in mind that just entertainment. Excellent, excellent purchase.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game accurately recreates what it would be like to be a bureaucrat working the border outpost of a communist dictatorship - your dayjob is mind-numbingly dull, the pay sucks balls (to the extent that you take bribes whenever you can or your family starves to death), and eventually the secret police will think you're a traitor and try and execute you.

239030,"Papers, Please","I picked up this game a year ago, needing a small game to tide me over since I couldn't really get involved in big immersive RPGs. I was extremely surprized with that I got.  I had heard Papers Please is a good game but I didn't expect the kind of addiciton that makes you play it for 7 hours straight. It's hard to pin point what really achieves this level of addiction. But it's probably a combination of genuine challenge, an interesting story line and essentially thousands of moral choice elements for 20 possible endings.  Don't snub it, it's a fantastic game.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","The best game.  You need to play this. It is a work of art. The atmosphere and plot alone are better than some AAA titles. The 'morality' choices you will make are deeper, and more fulfilling than any sort of binary 'good/evil' choice you make in games that try to simulate it. (Like bioware or bethesda games.) You will find yourself roleplaying, perhaps against your will.  Do an internet search for the free beta and play it for a taste. The finished product is even richer.  I guess the gameplay may not be for everyone. But, I love it. It has a unique tension all its own as you wait to find if the person you admitted was legitimate or not.  Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

Yes, it's a 'Paperwork Simulator.' Or as Yahtzee put it best, a 'Beurocracy 'em up.' And yet it genuinely is something worth trying. I doubt it will enrapture everyone, it's definitely for the 'Art Game' demographic - but it gets its point off well, and is a surprisingly engrossing thriller of sorts and there's a weird charm and atmosphere that takes you in, and while its still best played in short bursts - it doesn't get as repetitive as it might seem either.

239030,"Papers, Please","Many games and companies claim to be inovated or trying to push the norm and being progressive. In the past Nintendo were the biggest innovators pushing the gaming industry with new ideas on how to play video games. The past few years the gaming industry has seen little to almost no new ideas since the wii came to store shelves. All of this is important because you won't see innovation from some big company; you will find it from some indie developer called Lucas Pope. A man who used to work for Naughty Dog Studios working on the beaten to death series Uncharted broke free and decided to do his own thing.   This game just surprised me from every aspect and I just wanted more and more. The gameplay consist of reading things carefully and making sure everything matches to what it is supposed to be. If things don't match or seem fishy you will deny or detain a person. Sounds easy at first but you must do all this under a strict clock. You get money for every person you deny or pass, but you do thing wrong and you get fined for it. And you need this money to pay rent, feed your family, keep them warm, and healthy. You can barely get enough money to do all of these things for your family. You need to manage your money very carefully.    This game is maybe one of the best games I played in my life. It is so different and original and it does it all in such a fantastic way. I highly reccomend everyone to play this game if you ever get the chance. I only wish more games to take such new approaches to gameplay can come out sooner.",1,0

Essentially, in this game you play as a border agent who has to examine passports and other official documentation to determine whether a person is allowed entry into your country or not.

If you mess up, you'll be deducted pay at the end of the work day and your family will undoubtedly suffer as a result. While it sounds rather tedious and repetitive, it does suck you in.

239030,"Papers, Please","Frankly, this game is masterfully done. The idea is original, the graphics fit the claustrophobic and choking atmosphere, the music enhances the idea of a smothering government regime in which the player finds himself as both citizen and employee, and the stories told through the window of your booth are engaging and develop themselves with intrigue and secrecy. It's hard to find where this game could be improved. It's something that works so well as a game, and as an educational experience that it could almost be used in a teaching environment. The idea that a citizen of this government would be placed into the position they are, allowing or denying various people access to their country, seeing the amount of paperwork involved, watching the rules and regulations pile up and change over the course of time leading to frustration, being faced with the moral dilemmas asked of them, and deciding how to handle their allegiance to country versus their conscious and compassion for other human beings is something that truly isn't captured as well as it is here with Papers, Please.   I will say that the game is so well done, that it actually feels like work after awhile, which cuts into the fun factor, though it enchances the simulation aspect. It's almost hard to qualify it into a genre. The mechanics are crisp and clean, they build on themselves day after day, slowly increasing the difficulty by usually adding one or two additional rules, and eventually the player will find that they are totally immersed in the experience. It does feel like work after awhile though, so some players may actually be glad to 'punch out' after an hour or two of game play.  This is a game that has left me thinking about it long after I exit the program. It's something that reaches a state where it's actually more than a game, it's a slice of actual human life.   This falls into the same category as This War of Mine in that it's an important game, and one that people should play with more in mind that just entertainment. Excellent, excellent purchase.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Quick Breakdown:  A stellar game where you play as an inspector working at a border checkpoint between your communist country of Arstotzka, and the neighboring country Kolechia, which your country has just recently ended a 6 year war with.  Length:  2-4 hours (Main game), 8-10 (Completionists)  Score:  8.5/10   Full Review:  Papers Please is a truly unique game. Admittedly, it’s a pretty tough sell. On paper, the game sounds like it’d be awful. Even when I purchased the game, I wasn’t really sold on it, but I took a chance on it based on the ravings from my friends, and the low sale price of $2.50. After playing the game, I’m glad I did. It’s worth getting at full price even, but this is Steam, we all wait for the sales, don’t we?  So why’s it a tough sell? Well, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint. People give you their papers needed to enter, and you look over them and either let them enter your country, deny them entry if their papers are not all in order, or even detain them if need be. Sound like fun? To me it didn’t, but maybe you can see the appeal there.  So why is it worth playing? Odd as it may be, that very task I talked about in the last paragraph actually is a lot of fun. But there’s further reason that is even more compelling. You work for the glorious country or Arstotzka, at the checkpoint the border town of Grestin. The half of Grestin belongs to the neighboring country of Kolechia, which Arstotzka has just ended a 6 year war with. Your border checkpoint has just opened because of this, and people are once again allowed to enter Arstotzka for the first time in 6 years. This setting, and the people it brings through your checkpoint, and the events it leads to, are the game’s biggest strengths. You’ll encounter natives trying to re-enter the country, foreigners who can finally come to Arstotzka to work or visit, or even just pass through. There will also be terrorists, who aim to harm your glorious country, and it is your duty to deny and even detain them.  The game’s story and dialogue are both well written. Your actions during the day (the gameplay portion, which we’ll get to in a moment) affect the story between days, and down the road. Both the one time characters passing through, and those who are recurring are interesting, and some even quite memorable. (I think everyone who’s played this game loves Jorji). The dialogue is quite good, and has plenty of memorable lines.  So what of the gameplay? It’s done in a single screen, divided into 3 portions. Roughly the top third of the screen is a top down view of the border checkpoint, the line, and the guards. This part isn’t used too often for gameplay. The bottom two thirds of the screen are divided as well, the left third presents a first person point of view from your place inside your border checkpoint. This is where applicants seeking entry to Arstotzka come in and give you your papers. The rest of the bottom portion of your screen is where you can look at said papers up close.  Now this is the part of the game that I think is the hardest part to sell someone on, but I’m going to try anyway. When the game starts, applicants give you a passport, and so long as they are a resident of Arstotzka with a valid passport, they may enter the country. You simply stamp all passports with either “approved” or “denied.” At the end of the day you will be paid 5 credits for every person you correctly processed. The first two incorrectly processed applicants will earn you a citation with a warning and no payment, each error after that will also incur a penalty docking some of your pay. Citations are reset at the beginning of each day.  During this end of day phase you will also need to balance your finances, and decide if you have money to pay for heat in your apartment, or to purchase food for your family. If you’re not able to take care of them properly they can die. If they’re all dead, or if you run out of money entirely you’ll get a gamer over (there are other ways to get a game over, in total the game has 20 different endings). So it’s important to do your job well.  On day 2 things become more complicated, and foreigners may enter as well so long as their passport is valid. On each passport you have various things to check for, a valid issuing city, that their photo matches their physical appearance, and that it hasn’t yet expired.  As the days go on more documents and rules will be introduced. I won’t go over all of them, but you will also have documents for entry permits, work permits, and you’ll need to crosscheck the name and passport number -as well as other information- on these documents with what’s printed on their passport. Sometimes you’ll also need to fingerprint an applicant, or search them for weapons or contraband (can’t let the drug smugglers and terrorists in). You’ll need to go over the documents carefully, pointing out discrepancies, and even giving a proper reason for denial. On occasion you’ll need to detain some of the applicants instead of simply denying them entry.  That about covers the basics of the game, so let’s move on to the graphics. They’re done in a simple pixel style, they’re not anything fancy, but they are pleasant to look at, and they help set the dreary mood of the game.  And it is quite dreary working this sort of job in an oppressive country, barely making enough to care for your family and survive. The music is good, and helps compliments this mood, and so do the sound effects.  My main criticism of the game is levelled at trying to point out discrepancies. Now, it’s not that I have issue doing this, I enjoy it. No no, my issue is that while you know which rule is broken, it’s not always clear how to properly point this out. Once you do figure it out, it’s a non-issue the next time you must deny someone entry for the same reason, and it’s not an issue most of the time, but it happens occasionally, and there’s not really a good reason for it. In the end though, Papers Please is a fantastic game. If you’ve not played it yet, hopefully I’ve been able to convince you to give it a go, if you’re on the fence though, I urge you to gamble on it anyway, wait for a sale even if you wish. Just make sure that you do play this game.  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","In Papers, Please, you play as the newly-installed border agent for the fictional dystopian country of Arstotzka. Reviewing passports, forms, tickets, permits, scans, fingerprints, ID cards, and vaccination records against an increasingly complex and daily-changing set of rules, you are the judge of whether each newcomer is granted entry, turned away, detained, or even shot.  Sandwiched among the ordinary visitors, travelers, immigrants, asylum seekers, and diplomats, you encounter characters whose future rely on your discretion. These encounters range from the humorous to the heartwrenching, and you have to decide whether to adhere to your guidelines or your sense of right and wrong, whether you're better off taking a bribe or accepting your piecework pay. Some of these decisions have gameplay consequences, while others are merely matters of conscience. Meanwhile, your ability to pay for your family's basic needs rests upon your ability to quickly and accurately process the line of faces waiting in front of you each day. To me, these encounters and decisions were the most compelling part of the game. The player is able to make interesting and consequential choices and either advance or hinder an underground rebellion movement, as well as the lives of individual people.  Most of the time, though, you're just processing paperwork, and that's about as interesting as you would expect. The game does a good job of simulating the inanity and tedium of comparing item after item against rule after rule, checking for discrepancies; of pulling out the 'DENIED' stamp, aligning the passport under it, pressing down upon the stamp, putting the stamp away again, and handing each piece of paper back to its owner. If you like details a lot, are a bit OCD, or enjoy spot-the-difference games, this might become curiously addictive for you, but even as I compulsively continued to stamp paperwork, I experienced a nagging sense that what I was doing felt more like work than fun. I played through the story mode twice for the achievements, and although I was much better at processing the paperwork the second time around, I also found myself thinking about how many game days were still coming with an odd sense of dread. The first time around, there was at least the tension of whether I'd be able to make it through the full month and get to the end of the story (on my very first try, I reached the ending where you run out of money very early on), but on my repeat playthrough, I felt like I had to go through a great deal of tedium to reach the few meaningful encounters that I was interested in experiencing again, differently.  The game does feature several different 'endless' modes, complete with leaderboards, but I see very little incentive to play them, since for me they remove the best parts of the game and keep the most dull. But if processing an infinite line of passports holds appeal for you, that option is available.  One final note: the save system in Papers, Please is excellent. It uses a branching system that allows you to start from the beginning of any game day in any of your previous playthroughs and continue from there, making going back for achievements or to see alternate endings much easier than it might otherwise have been.  Overall, I'd recommend this game for its unique concept, quirky humor, evocative decision-making, and immersive ambience. The story is worth seeing through to a few of its 20 possible endings -- but probably not all of them. Keep in mind, however compelling this game is, it's still a simulation about paperwork.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is certainly not a review about the game itself. We ALL know how great it is.  I'm here to talk about the quality of its Linux port. I'm not surprised that an indie title has flawless support so far, compared to certain AAA titles I will not mention right now.  Everything works as you'd expect, display, input, audio... no major problems. There's just a rare issue with certain lines of text having a whole row of pixels chopped off, but it doesn't affect readability (if it happens on Windows too, then it's all ok).  PS: I like the fact on fullscreen it uses nearest neighbor interpolation and keeps pixels square. I'm kind of a sucker for that.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I didn't buy this last time I'd seen it on sale, but it had certainly peaked my interest. I bought it this time and I'm glad I did!  I wasn't really expecting much of this game, but it ended up being splendid - simple yet wonderful. You have a choice no matter the situation and you have up to twenty endings you could end up with (reminds me of those stories when I was a child with the multiple endings, can't remember what they're called). Most of the endings seem to require different sacrifices you have to make along the way and give a realistic insight to the life of a border officer. It explores not only moral issues but corruption, blackmail, terrorism, bribery, etc. which is honestly a good portrayal of today's society. Following the rules to a T or being honest will not give you a good ending.   As each day moves forward, you are introduced to new daily tasks, many of which might be unfair to the person crossing the border. You get plenty of different people - some who are obviously crooks and some who just want to be free of their old country or visit a family member. There's a secret organization trying to infiltrate your country as well and whether you decide to help them or not, the consequences might never be the same.   I don't know. It's entertaining and makes you ask questions. I think that makes this game a very good one, despite how repetitive it is. You're at least engaged with the central story and your life, your family's lives, and countless other families' lives depend on your decision, whereas other games like this might not make you have such conscious choices where so much relies on said choices, which really makes Papers, Please stand out.  Definitely recommended. (:",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A friend of mine once remarked that there's no way to describe this game that still makes it sound fun once you've explained it. By all reason, Papers Please shouldn't be as much of a good time as it is. You serve as an unnamed male citizen of the Arstozkan Empire, employed by lottery to rigorously scan and verify documents at the newest border crossing station in your dystopian, communist nation circa the 1980s. The names are all changed, but you essentially control Checkpoint Charlie at the Berlin Wall, and it's your job to make sure illegal immigration in your sector grinds to a halt. If you fail, your impoverished family will starve and freeze even worse than they already do.  But in spite of all its Cold War doom and gloom, Papers Please is a wonderfully intricate and engaging experience. The charm and humor of its characters, such as the permanently cheerful Jorgi Costava or the irascible Dimitri (Your supervisor, who stops by to inform you how bad you're doing each week) draws you in with each passport you process. Soon, you're reading your employee handbook to pass the time, determined to serve your country well and provide for your family. Or maybe you begin working undercover with the resistance, smuggling revolutionaries into the country with falsified papers. Or maybe you set up a smuggling business with a few regular border-crossers, and plan to flee the country yourself.   With 20 different endings to unlock and hundreds of stories to hear, Papers Please is unique kind of game; one that defies the genres of the medium and forces us to think differently about our entertainment. I highly recommend you pick it up. And remember! Always read the daily bulletin!  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

Another outstanding fact about this game is how much it makes you question what sort of person you are, will you do your duty to your country and do as they request?

Will you work hard, not questioning the authorities and provide for your family; or do you make a sacrifice to help the common folk? That's up to you! A lot of other things go on, but I'll leave you to discover that because it's pretty mind blowing on your first play through! (As the game says, it's a Thriller)  The gameplay is also surprisingly fun for a game about checking over paperwork, it involves a lot of thought and skill! It is extremely unique and it constantly throws new rules onto your job based on the events that happen in the game world, changing up the gameplay and making it more interesting day by day!   The game also has a lot of replay value, with many different endings you can achieve and lots of different ways the story can drive forward based on your choices each day. You can replay any day or start a completely new game at any time without losing the progress of later days, so they give you full freedom to experiment and retry when things don't go how you wanted them to!

Yeah, this game is bleak, boring, and depressing. And yet I'm still stamping passports. What the hell?",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","While the first glimpse says to a store-wanderer ''boring, boring, boring'', this idea is completely false. Papers, Please is the complete opposite of boring.  Taking place in a fictional   semi-corrupt semi-just-want-MIA-members-kept-in-place   country named Arstotzka, you play as a border control agent, accepting or denying job-seekers, immigrants and criminals. While this game's first few hours/minutes (depending on how quick your fingers are and how long it takes to strain them dragging documents around your messy desk) are quite dull, the people I saw in just that little amount of gameplay made me rage, laugh and stare. This is a brilliant attribute as it jolts the brain and your emotions to a flying start. Time to time the game gets harder and more time-consuming, but still follows the same laugh-rage experience. It also displays attributes of a shooter - you will sometimes see a terrorist attack and have the power to stop one at your protagonist's twiddling fingers.   It also gives you opinions and puzzles   (including the bomb some idiot thought would kill off an inspector and all the guards surrounding him)  , like managing your expenses and doing whatever it takes to not be arrested for giving a single document to the police. While this isn't too frequent it still makes you happy there's a change in the game and you have some freedom.   Graphics-wise the game is pixellated, but looks lovely at the same time. This style fits the time the game was set, as I just thought, considering it is set in the 80s, a time when 8-bits were first introduced. It also displays musical talent, and the theme makes me want to go on a march in synchronization with it.   So, overall, I'd say Papers, Please, from such a simple idea, turns out to be one of my favourite games of all time, and I congratulate Dukope for making such a brilliant game.  10/10.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a repetitive but challenging indie game where you act as a border control passport inspector. The goal of the game is to let the qualified people pass and reject the inqualified people. Every day there is a new set of rules or addition to the rules making each day still challenging and fun. The game is challenging at first to learn of the different conditions and what each is (such as the passport nations). However later on it becomes more of a 'spot the error' kind of game. If you get 2 wrong, you will not be penalized, but if you get 3 wrong, you will start to lose money. At the end of every day you can devote your money to different things such as heat and food. However, if you chose not to devote money to those for long enough, bad things will happen to your family which is dependent on the money.

Just looking at someone's face and seeing if it matches the passport photo isn't all of it, a lot of minor detail is included so that you have to pay attention carefully such as expiry date on the passport and region they are from etc. Don't worry, you get a warnings if you get it wrong but any more than 2 mistakes and you get fined. As you progress through the story, it's gets more challenging and there is more specific requirements thrown at you such as workers have to present a valid work permit and certain documents are needed. When you finish work, you get your pay and you have to feed your family, pay for heating and if your family is ill; medicine. The worst part is to make wise decisions, such as sacrificing heating for your sons medicine, if you don't pay for the medicine, your family member might die and thats pretty depressing since your salary is quite low. Although it might sound boring, there is an actual storyline to it, some events happen and your choice of actions might change the story a bit. You'll be glad that everyone you meet are different. Also, you can get some grumpy people who can ♥♥♥♥ you off or you can get people who are desperate to migrate because of war and they beg you to let them in even though they don't have a passport.

Did you become best friends with a drug dealer? No (again very slim chance of yes). Correct me if I am wrong, but there are no other games like Papers please, that offer the different varity of game play and gameplay mechanics.

239030,"Papers, Please","One of the most inventive games I've ever come across, a true masterpiece, telling the story of a border agent in a fictional Communist nation Arstotzka, which has recently emerged from a 6-year-long war with neighbour Kolechia. Traveling to the border after being selected in the October Labour Lottery, you bring along your wife, son, mother-in-law and uncle, you must determine who is allowed to enter the nation, with the criteria for entry becoming increasingly long, to the point where entrants almost need a permit to open doors. The story is amazingly immersing, and I just can't stop listening to the endlessly looping menu music. A true masterpiece that demonstrates why indie games are the gateway into the games industry, with ideas like this Lucas Pope and 3909 are definitely going places.  A truly 10/10 experience, and easily one of the best, if not the best, game of 2013.",1,0

This game simulates a life in a totalitarian regime where you work on the border, deciding people's lives. If you do good and let people who don't have a passport but want to go over the border continue, your pay will be deducted. If you don't have money, your family will starve, and if you don't have money to pay the bills you will be arrested. On the other hand, if you don't help the people you will feel like you are a terrible person. I made this mistake once in the game, and never again. I destroyed their regime, saved my family, but alas my son has died.

This continues to build as more complex events occur adding more and more information to verify and new methods to test the stories of the masses.

239030,"Papers, Please","At a glance Papers, Please is a distopian document checking simulator, and it is, but it is also so much more. Not only is the stress of having to go through passports, entry visas, diplomatic documents, requests for asylum and trying to shoot down any people jumping the border fun, it's also extremely immersive.  This game gets you lost in the fictional country of Arstotzka and makes come to love and hate it. But gameplay aside this game shown me something no game as shown me as of yet. It showed me that I am a corrupt, easily persuaded and cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Well I guess I already knew I am a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but none the less this game showed it to me again. 'How did it do that?' you may ask, and let me tell you. This game gives you a family that you grow to love. I took bribes, shot people, poisoned people and let people in illeagally if I thought it would let my family have ten extra dollars. If someone told me a sob story about why they couldn't get in I did not care. If they had the wrong papers they do not go in. I arrested people that didn't need to be arrested because there was a chance I'd earn an extra five dollars. It made me hate those dirty Kolechian scumbag terrorists. Every time I let a Kolechian through I hold the key to the tranqualiser just in case he decides to pull something stupid. This game tells a story very few other games do. You're choices have consequences that can be seen. You helped the order? You'll see it in the news paper the next day. The satisfaction of knowing that you are helping your country is great.  This game also has one of the most nerve wracking moments ever. If you mark someone's passport with an entry granted stamp, give it to them but then realise you forgot to check something, the next three seconds of them walking in will be the scariest of your life, hoping that you he had everything right, and if you hear that awful fax machine noice telling you that you stuffed up, you want to cry.  This game has multiple endings, which in my opinion is one of the best things a game could have. Will you help the order? Will you maintain your poor work standards and loose your job? Or will you find a way to claw yourself out from the bottom to the top?  Papers, Please is a game about success, failure and trials. This game teaches us who we are. Are we in it for ourselves or will we take a more utilitarianism approach? In the end it's a game about survival. Papers, Please is more than a document simulator.  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

However, many events will occur which may make you want to bend the rules. There will be many funny moments, as well as sad or scary ones. Will you remain loyal to your country, even though it barely pays you, or help incite a rebellion in the hope of a better future?",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Immigration inspector simulator  'Papers, Please' is a point and click, puzzle game developed by 3909.  There isn't much story in the game. You basically play as a immigration inspector who manages who get into the country of Azoska (as well as look after your family). Certain events are detailed via text boxes or in the newspaper. There a over ten endings in the game, which occur based on player action.  Gameplay is exceptional. You need to check the credentials of people who are entering the country and only let in people who meet the laws. This includes checking height, photo, passports, work visa etc. to find any discrepencies. If there are no problems you let them through, else you have to deny access into the country. At each level, you only have a limited amount of time to work and earn money. Therefore you have to arrange where each piece of document you are given goes (either on the desk or counter) so you can efficiently check and hand those papers back as quickly as possible in order get the next visitor and hence more money. Each person you let in earns you ten dollars, while at the same time any mistakes you make (after the first one) will deduct money from you. Money is used at the end of the level to pay for your family's needs e.g. food and rent. Failure to earn enough money will mean that your family members start dieing off. Your moraility will also be tested in the game with various decisions such as whether to accept bribes, detain people to get more money, whether to let a grieving mother through etc. Basically you have to manage your job, family and morales during the game.  There is minimal audio in the game. Alarms and paper sound as they should. People speak via text boxes and some of their dialogue are quite humorous.  Graphics aren't that detaile, but they do a good job at setting a surpressive atmosphere.  If you want to have unique, somewhat-funny point and click game, this game won't dissapoint.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is a game that stuck with me and told a grim yet realistic story. While the graphics aren't spectacular and it's not the high intense gameplay you can get from other games, this is a game that took a mundane job and made it into a political commentary. I was skeptical initially thinking that a paper pushing game would be easy and I'd get bored of it. In reality, it was the opposite. The game's difficulty progressed with the story line, or in other words, the levels of bureaucracy and trying not to get too many citations. It gets harder when you have to deal with terrorists and providing for your family. The historical backdrop of East and West Germany (ofc in fictional terms) made it even more realistic and moving. This game impacted me and it is a true masterpiece.  Of course, it is not flawless, at times it can feel a bit repetitive and while you can have many endings (20 in fact), it's hard to replay it immediately (better wait a few months to try it again).   In short, if you'd like a break from an FPS and try to be an immigration inspector then this game is for you.  Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","The concept of this game could be deemed to be somewhat repetitive, however the main point of the game is to make the player think. Finding the discrepancies between the documents can be quite engaging at times, as you have to make sure that they follow the rules that are set out. Following these rules such as remembering what is and what is not allowed, stamping documents can be challenging and for the first time possibly overwhelming, however the more you play the easier it gets and you will have a better experience. The pixel art style works well for this game as it gets you to focus more about the task at hand rather than the graphics shown. This game is definitely one to play if you have an hour or so to pass.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of those very pleasant, tiny surprises that comes along every now and again. And I do mean tiny: 30 megs tiny. That's four times the price of an iTunes HD episode for less than one-fifteenth the size, but believe me when I say that you'll spend more time on this game than you ever would watching any episode of any TV show.  The power of the game lies in its simple and complex art style and moral elements, respectively. Your position sees very little of any colour other than greys and blacks, probably reflecting that the morality that the game pushes you towards. Almost your money goes to rent, food and heat for your family at the end of each workday, and you get paid by how many people you process correctly. This would normally just serve to give the players incentive to pay attention and not ♥♥♥♥ up, but the game has the simple trick of any citizen just claiming what any citizen would. Maybe they want to get into the country to see their family or reunite with their significant other, and turning them away means breaking that. Of course, letting them through means you might not be able to afford heat this evening.  The game has problems, sure. If you're not the type for it, the morality system falls completely flat and you just don't care, because there's no real penalty for simply doing your job aside from citizens calling you an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in 16-bit text before disappearing forever. The booth upgrades aren't very helpful, and I can't say that this is the most thrilling game to play if you're playing on a stationary rig that can run many more exciting, if not as compelling, games. That being said, it is still surprisingly engaging for its size; I found myself able to play it (before I bought the Steam version) in class for sometimes hours at a time, just processing and processing over and over. And its size and almost non-existant graphical tax means that no matter your specs, you could run it.  In conclusion, it's more than worth recommending. The phrase 'Simple, yet elegant' is thrown around a lot but it really does find a place here, amongst the endless passports and tickets that will inevitably clutter your desk. If you're the type for it, pick it up anyway, but if you're on the move a lot and switching computers, frequently finding yourself with nothing to do, I couldn't recommend Papers, Please higher. It takes some real talent to make a job that should be boring fun and captivating, and that's just what Mr. Pope has done.  Final Score: 8.5/10",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of the most innovating and impressive games from this year. Being a sort of point-and-click game, Papers, Please excels in the way it uses it.  You take the role of an Arstotzkan border controller who regulates the border checkpoint in Grestin, Arstotzka. You must earn money by doing your job accordingly and with as few errors as possible in order to feed and protect your family, as well as keeping them healthy and living under a roof.  The game focuses on the basic mechanics of point-and-click, but uses this mechanic in a very different way by allowing the player to check entrees' passports as they attempt to enter the country of Arstotzka. Your duty, as border controll, is to make sure that only people with valid documents enter the country. If you make any errors, small amounts of your salary will be held back, and you may even allow in a terrorist if the person that you allowed entrance carried a bomb and you forgot to x-ray them because they had expired documents, for example.  The game has a very simple art direction, as well as a very simple sound design. Lucas Pope, the creator of the game, really nailed it with Papers, Please, as he created something inspiring, entertaining, and very different.  Papers, Please is one of its kind, and is one of those rare indie games that you should defnitely try out.  The only complaint I have is that the main story is too short, but even so, the game has a freemode and so you can continue to play on without focusing on the main story, even though the main story is crafted in a specific way and has its own events, the freemode is very fun too.

239030,"Papers, Please","With over 20 hi-standard awards achieved already, Papers, Please is seriously ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES published in 2013.  It's old-school, it's innovative, also imo beautiful in a classic way in its brutally simple appeareance and it made me laugh out loud few times (can't remember when single-player made me actually laugh :D). The concept itself is let alone just brilliant but when laced with a great storytelling in which player can impact and with a gameplay that enhances the back-to-the-childhood feeling you get, Papers, Please is one to remeber. Just the ancient-sounding theme music brings an amused grin to your face - a reminder of the good old times. This is not easy game by any means, requires some brains and sharp eye but not in an annoying way. I found the difficulty very fitting and enjoyable.   Papers, Please may not offer something to play for a very long time right away (depends on person), that said it will surely exceed its value by far anyway in the hands of an average gamer. On the other hand I can see myself returning to this game in future, similarly as with e.g. Max Payne, DOOM, etc. I do not want to give spoilers - one's has to experience this game like it happens in it's story - out of the blue. As I fancy 2013 not a great year regarding to game releases I am glad I have now something to remember and to recommend to fellow gamers.   Glory to Arstotzka!",1,1

What is with all these indie or early access games that are turning out better than 90% of the AAA games this year?  Anyways, to the game, the atmosphere is well done, the gameplay is fun as hell and it is original. I think the only people who won't like this game are graphics who**** who only like games with beautiful graphics. This game is MUCH more than what you see, check it out! You have to investigate and check peoples passports at a check point. There can be terrorists,etc.. and as you get further into the game you have more things you can use to try and find the people who should not be in entering the country. I actually have felt bad a few times when I had to turn some people down. Very well made game and I hope the devs are working on another game in this series or another new game.",1,0

No 'Save/Harvest' here, often both your choices have drawbacks and you must weigh their long-term consequences against the short term benefits (or vice versa).  The music and the fantastic pixel art style depicting a soviet-like dystopian setting elevate it to genius level.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an indie game developed by Lucas Pope, in which you play an immigration inspector whom is working at a border checkpoint in a country named Arstotzka . The goal of the player is to inspect documents using a set of tools and in some occasions to inspect the individual per se, in order to keep criminals out of the country . Everything is a bit unknown, until it will be disclosed , the more you play .   Every work day, you receive a document with informations about particular things you have to notice about, the arrival of important people and/or if you have to take some measures if a specific occasion happens, like having to do body scanning to all civilians who belong to the country of Kolechia . We also have a rule book all the time, so we can know what is allowed in the documents we inspect and if there are any discrepancys, you have to reject the entry to the person and later on, if you want, arrest them . A situation with a spy, terrorists and smugglers with not be uncommon, and you will decide if you will let them pass by, because you can bribed and even threaten .  After a day of work, you receive a wage, which depends on how well you did your job, and you will have to decide where your wage will go, some option include 'food', 'medicine' and 'heat', also as you progress in the story you will be able to choose to move to a better house, but it will also have bigger expenses . You also have freedom of will in basically everything since the game changes with your decisions .  Be careful too, this game will play your emotion and will play mind games with you, sometimes you must choose between doing your job or doing the right thing sometimes, there will be families slip apart because of you, but if you decide to let someone passe the border without the correct documents so he or she can be with her/his family, you will face the consequences . Your gaming experience with this game could end in 20 different ways, each occur depending on what decisions did you take in a certain way because you actually have a lot of choices throughout the story, some of them may include, being part of a conspiration group named EZIC against the government of Arstotzka, accepting bribes and even saving money on medicine or food, which will let to the starvation of members of your family .   This game is worth all your attention, since its incredibly addicting, has a great plot and the gameplay its really original, you will not regret it .    Glory To Arstotzka!    ~ 10/10",1,0

I think, though, that this game is worth buying for a multitude of reasons. This game requires the player to be very observant. I find it interesting that everything you do in this game affects the story line. I do recommend this game for people who like the Stanely Parable and other strategy games.  Brief Overview (Don't worry, no spoilers...): You have just won the labor lottery, giving you a job working for border patrol. While working for the patrol you have to accept or deny people into the country based on their criminal record, ID, and etc. Some people try to forge documents and illegaly get into the country. You can choose to help the country with its corrupt government, or you can gain the trust of the country and try to destroy it from the inside. Even though all you do is click your mouse and choose wether people are entering or not, I find this game very fun and neat. 8.5/10",1,0

Being from or conected to the eastern bloc from where this story draws its roots will help a lot for the general feeling. It will hit home in a special way, but I don’t think it’s mandatory.

239030,"Papers, Please","First of all, this game is depressing.  It puts you in the boots of a poor paper pusher at a border-checkpoint of a dictatorship(ed?) country .   While you are struggeling to keep your family fed and warm, you are deciding over human lives in a always shorter timeframe. Why this? The faster you check the immigration papers of people seeking refuge, the more money you earn each day. But if you make mistakes you can loose money as well. This gets harder every day as the administration releases more and more rules and admittances for you to check. At the same time the game throws you into some moral decisions, where there is no right or wrong. Do I turn down the human-trafficer, although his papers are ok? This could lead to a fine and I could not afford the medicine for my son. Do I take the bribe from the nice man claiming to smuggle medicin for his sick wife?  As I said... this game is depressing. Would I recommend you to buy and play it?  Yes!   Because this game manages something only few games manage to do. To get you involved and question your own morality.  And even if you do not get involved in this depressing atmosphere. The game is still a very good reaction-puzzle-like game that needs you to figure out where the small mistake in the forged immigration documents in front of you is.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","To be brief, Papers, Please is a game that is unlike any other in terms of gameplay. The best way to describe it is working in Stalin's DMV, sifting through enough papers throughout a day to make a redwood tree flinch in horror. Unique gameplay itself is more than enough to give Papers, Please a look, but what really makes the game pop is its story. Everyone has problems, and you are no exception. The game puts you in a mentality that lets the little details get to you, taking perfect advantage of its setting to make you worried about even getting to work another day.

One passport accepted will get you only five credits, got a warning where you got to pay is five credits. Denying a passport will get you no credits, and you need the credits at the end of the day. At the end of the day is when your cash will go to use, first is warnings that you got to pay, no matter what you need to pay, next is the rent, it's like real life you need to pay for your house/apartments/box, no matter what you need to pay. Finally is the heat and food, this is the only items that you can check off of not paying, your family of five - Wife, Kid, Uncle, and Mother-In-Law - can go hungry, cold, or both.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is by far one of the best indie games I have ever played! Papers Please was created from scratch by one man. Papers Please reflects on the checkpoints situated in Berlin during the Cold War. You might think that looking at dates, numerical values and pictures is boring, but the way PP does it is really great. It's a fun puzzle game that keeps you thinking.  Everything from the music to the pixelated graphics is topnotch quality. Everyone has different passports and there are different ways of dealing with situations. You have to watch out for workers, diplomats, terrorists, spies and people of the secretive Order group.   Of course, this game is not for everybody. If you enjoy playing generic COD shooters and that's all you play, this is not for you. You are working under time to deny and accept as many people into your country as possible without being fined. You have a family to look after and they all depend on you to pay for food, heat, medicine and rent in your class 8 dwelling.   However, I really wish for new content to be added, like a war breaks out between Arstotzka and another nation and new enemies are added, or you are relocated to a whole new checkpoint or something.

It is a truly terrific game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys an atmospheric, story-driven game.   Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a dystopian game about border security, although this may seem rather tedious initially, the small, simplistic graphics and constant worry of your family and other challenges presented to the player cause a near total immersion experience, so much so that I forgot to eat for the first time I played it.

239030,"Papers, Please",Glory to Arstotzka!  The game is quite different. You're the border entry point official dude who gets to decide if people can come in or not.

239030,"Papers, Please","I would say the subtitle of 'dystopian document thriller' is partly correct. The setting and mechanics in this game are fairly unique I think, where you play a border agent in a country with an oppressive government.  The gameplay itself is actually fairly routine, and can be summarized as rule memorization and observation skills. This is fine, as it works and makes sense within the story. The sound design and aesthetic lend to this very well. There were no performance issues.  I don't think there is that much replayability to the story despite the variety of endings. There is an unlockable endless mode, which could make this fun as a pastime too Still, I'd reccomend this game for its unique experience. Its really not something you see every day.",1,0

'Papers, please' rewards you with a salary based on your speed and accuracy. The money you earn are necessary to support your family, so you'd better work hard.

239030,"Papers, Please","Simple, yet challenging game... Seems more like an actual job than a game infact, though it can be a challenge to be 100% about details... unless you hack of course...  The Game mechanic is basically looking at documents and picking out infomation, about a person, that is right or incorrect, and judging whether they have the right enter or be sent away. Fo instance, you will often have to check dates, passport numbers and even have people strip searched! The quicker you do it, the more people you 'process' and therefore the more money you get and the better chance your family dont die' (If your family die : the state sacks you as it seeks to help people with larger families...

You have to make choices that affect not only you, but the world around you as well. There are choices you make that match risk with reward, and there are choices where you must decided in between this person and your family. Every error you make gets a citation, and after two citations, you get docked payment. People ask you to smuggle them out of the city, but doing so can get your payment docked.

For example: on a day, a mother that hasn't seen her son for 6 years will come with an expired document, and this is her only chance to enter, you must choose between denying her, or approving her.  on another day, a husband and wife from a country that they describe as 'tyrannic' are escaping to Arstotzka, the husband has valid documents, but the wife is missing a document, you must choose (again) between denying or approving!  on another day, your sister will be arrested for an unknown reason, your niece now needs a home! your payment is low (5 credits/entrant), and you must choose between adopting her for 40 credits, or keep the money and leave her!  and the hardest of all, a strange group (called *SPOILERS! you must find out yourself!*) will come asking for your help to 'free Arstotzka from its shackles' and tell you that the country's leaders are corrupt and greedy. you can choose to help them and *SPOILERS!*, or you can choose to work for your country regardless and *SPOILERS!*  also, the border gets occasionally attacked by terrorists, at first you can't do anything and they cut the day short but later on, the government gives you a single tranquilizer gun with 3 darts, and now, defending the border is your responsibility (and they still cut the day short!)  the game is very stressing, at first, it will seem like an easy job, but it keeps getting harder and more stressing as you advance in the story, but once you find the key (Gotta go fast!) the game becomes easier, yet still stressful.  despite the stress, the game is great!

You have to deal with constantly changing regulations, need to maintain some level of accuracy to not get fined, yet you have pressure to pass as many people as possible through in order to feed your family. The game also makes you face countless moral dilemmas (accepting bribes, not allowing a husband to follow his wife due to missing a document, strip searching someone due to questionable gender), and really gives you a great amount of choice, with over 20 possible endings.

239030,"Papers, Please","Buy it now. This game may not look like much, but it is the most unique expierience I ever had in a game. You are selected by a lottery to work in a border checkpoint in the glorious country of Arstotzka and you spend 10 minute 'days' checking peoples documents and either accepting them or denying them. Each day the difficulty raises, whether it is having to watch out for criminals or stop terrorists who are attacking the checkpoint. At the end of the day you have a home screen. If you didn't process enough people, you may not have enough money to buy heat or food for your family.  This game shines with the people you process. In between the hundreds of people you process in your checkpoint there are little stories that are told. A basic one that you get very early on is that a husband has the required papers but his wife doesn't. The wife pleads to let her in and it is up to you. Do you go against your new rules and risk getting fined, or do you deny her and leave the family seperated (I denied her, Glory to Arstotzka!). Later in the game deeper stories uncover, including a plot to overthrow the government. Everything can change for these digital people because you decided one of two choices. It is amazing.  There are 20 different endings and an endless mode after you beat the story once. Overall this is one of the best indie games I played and I recommend it to everyone.  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Normally, a video game is made for entertainment. In 'Papers, Please', the entertainment is a side effect that comes from the engagement you have with the storyline.  'Papers, Please' challenges the very definition of a video game. Excluding open-ended games, most storyline-driven video games can be expressed in another media such as a written novel or a movie; even the most non-linear game with branching storylines and choices, which this game falls into that category. However, 'Papers, Please' can NOT be expressed in another media. It is a personal experience. Your emotion, your personality and your very own engagement with the story defines what the narrative is.  Don't let the graphics tip you off; if anything, if it does tip you off, then it's working on you, because the story is as cold as the visual suggests.  Gameplay-wise, it's a concept that would strangely be classified as 'novelty' despite the very administrative nature of the gameplay. It takes a boring and tiring process that is, reading and checking documents, and turns it into a formidably executed source of entertainment. The green stamp and the red stamp, they don't look terrifying but you'll quickly realize the amount of power they hold, because 'you' are the one stamping the documents.   Replayability will depend on your ability to ignore your emotions, if you do feel any.

239030,"Papers, Please","A glance at Papers, Please might cause someone to think 'Why would anyone want to play a game about checking for errors in documentation? That sounds like a job.' But if there's anything that we can learn from simulation games is that they don't have to be fun to draw you in, because once you find that each document is a window into a person's private life, and that you are reluctantly given the tough decision 'Should I let this person into my country?', you find that there is a dangerously comfortable flow.  This game confronts you with sequences of people who provide you documentation for immigrating to the ficticious country Arstotzka (based on the Soviet Union). You must carefully search their documents for errors and make sure that everything is in order before letting them in. But the genius behind this game soon becomes apparent. You have limited time, and the more people you let into the country before the end of the day, the more money you get. What do you need money for? Well, you have a large nuclear family who all rely on your income to take care of heating, food, medicine, and you will never be able to afford all of these things.   But you can't just let in everyone, because every time you permit a person with incorrect documentation to enter, you receive a citation, and eventually get docked pay. This creates a wonderful tension between wanting money and not loosing your job. And checking documents isn't easy, it's often tedius to compare spelling of names, or social security numbers, or expiration dates, or remembering what type of identification each person should be having, so making mistakes is a matter of a keen eye and a good memory for rules.   To make it even harder, you only have a third of the screen to place documents, so you can never see all of them at a time. But that wouldn't be stressful enough, because each person often has a story and in such a dystopian world, you find people who empathize with, but have bad documents, or people who are evil but have everythign in order. And the game will often send you reminders of decisions you made that ruined someone's life, or sometimes saved it.  And on top of all of this there is a plot about a group of revolutionaries who try to recruit you to their cause. And with the horrible bureaucracy you see around you, the revolutionaries have a good point, but you must decide whether to risk helping them, or to play it safe with a government that will hopefully leave you and your family alone.  What all this adds up to is a game that causes you to have to make the decisions that people in stressful bureaucratic jobs must make. In a way it forces you to begin to think more openly about why people at the DMV seem unhappy, or even show us how people in an authoritarian government may seem heartless, but are really trying to protect their family.  So purchase this game for your own education, if not for its compelling and intricate gameplay.  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an exciting game where you are playing as an volunteered inspector in a fake Communist country called Arstotzka after a six year war with Kolechia. Because of this you may experience a terrorist attack if a Kolechian passes. The game feels real and when I play it I feel like its really my duty to make sure everybody passes the border correctly without making any mistakes. What makes it feel more realistic is how you don't forget you have a family and you have to take care of them by making sure they are healthy, they have food to eat, and you have to buy things for their birthday. Even if you do have a crappy computer/laptop you can still play this game because you aren't moving around or going anywhere. The graphics are in 8 bit so that makes it better if you have a bad computer. You sit at a desk and make sure people pass the border without flaws. In some parts of the game you may have to go back levels which isn't very happy to find out, but it just made the game better for me. And even though sometimes you may be a bit low on cash you can turn on easy mode and earn an extra 20 bucks a day/level. Also, the music in this game makes it even more fun and playable. The only flaw I could find is, how nobody really likes you besides your family, Jorgi, and a guard. So on a scale of 1 to 10, this amazing game deserves a 9 out of 10.",1,0

At that moment i was not expecting Papers, Please to be one of the most absorbing and exciting games i've had the pleasure of playing, after my first play through of about 2 hours, i rushed to buy this game, as it simply wouldn't have been fair from my part not to.  The fact that the gameplay, which can basically be summed up as spot the differences, ends up being as engaging as it is, is truly a testament of the ability this game has draw you into the world and it's ambient. And for me personally I found this to be one of the most engaging experiences I've had with entertainment(including movies, books, etc), there were moments of moral decisions which call out to the best of mankind, at the cost of your 'score' in the game, which i find great since it makes us think more of what it is we are doing while playing a game, since it presents us with either the path to move the game forward and the cost of our morals, or stick to our beliefs despite the consequences, and i truly appreciate when a game makes us go that far.   I haven't been able to play all the games i've wanted to this year, however from the ones i've played, and from what i've seen and heard of the others, this is unapologetically my game of the year of 2013.    p.s.

239030,"Papers, Please","There are so many reasons why Papers Please is so appealing. It's got a typical BioWare plot, which means that there's a mystery that's so well thought out and told that everything clicks into place during the big reveal. Yet it's also a game made by sci-fi fans for those who love sci-fi. There are so many elements borrowed and culled from decades of science fiction and movies, and there are countless moments that will remind you of Star Trek or Aliens or Firefly or some early John Carpenter movie (the electronic score is very Carpenter-esque, too). There's even an effective film grain post-processing effect that makes the game feel like a 70s or 80s sci-fi movie, before digital filmmaking and CGI made everything look and feel too clean.  Here's the premise of Papers Please: Several hundred years in the future humanity has joined the galactic community after finding alien technology on Mars that opens up interstellar travel. We uppity humans are seen as too ambitious in a galaxy run by a UN-like council populated by ancient alien races. You play as The Inspector of the human Alliance military, and BioWare lets you role-play as either a male or female character. There are pre-rolled characters that you can select or you can create a custom character with a unique face.  When a rogue spectre--one of the galactic council's special agents--attacks a human colony on Eden Prime, you're tasked with hunting him down. It's not that simple, though, as invariably epic themes such as extinction on a galactic scale kick in. So you must zip around the galaxy in a very sleek starship, explore alien worlds, engage in futuristic firefights, and unearth the overarching mystery. There's also a cast of human and alien characters that can grow on you, like Wrex, a krogan killing machine with a blunt, sardonic personality. And this wouldn't be a game without one or two romance possibilities, as well.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is way more fun than it should be. Players take on the role of an immigration worker, checking passports and other paperwork at the border of a fictional country called Arstotzka. Your job is to make sure their paperwork is in order, and either let them pass into Arstotzka or turn them away. While this may sound like a simple, boring concept, it quickly becomes quite difficult, and the story kept me intrigued enough to keep playing long after it should have gotten boring. Players must balance duty with morality, while trying to bring in enough money to take care of the worker's starving, sick and cold family. Terrorists strike, family members die, and all along the way you must perform your job or risk being terminated. The simplistic 8-bit style graphics are not distracting: actually, they seem to add to the dreary, mundane atmosphere, allowing you to more fully immerse yourself in the dystopian world. There is a bit of comic relief (GLORY TO COBRASTAN!!!) but even with the minor comic relief, this game is dark and depressing in the most perfect way. It really makes the player think about society and political problems in a communist state, bringing up deep questions about humanity under the guise of a simple game.

Should I arrest the old woman for having false information on her passport? If I do, I will get a bonus that may well mean affording medicine for my wife. But then again, the old woman is hardly responsible for what is likely a typo made by an immigration officer as fallible as you. Should I listen to the mysterious revolutionaries?

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a very good game. It might not seem like it (Due to the fact that mostly all you do is press stamps on paperwork) but believe me, there is MUCH, MUCH more to this game. It has the perfect Dystopia. And it gets very interesting from time to time. For example, terrorist attacks could occur. A secret rebel organization bribes you in many differen't ways to convince into supporting their actions into destroying the corrupt government.   You can interrorgate people by having their pictures taken on a body scanner (Which could unvail some disturbing things the entrant might not want you to discover) such as having guns strapped on their backs, and even contraband strapped onto their legs, etc.   The bottom line is, this game has a lot of potential. There is even an excessive number of endings you could get (A little bit over 40 to be exact), to keep you more interested. 10/10",1,0

Red and green colors! But mostly the red. Well, if you like the color red, it's a plus! Not only that, you get the hate of an entire population (or so it feels) directed at you for denying them passage into the glorious Arstotzka. And you get to hate them back by denying them even more, those filthy heathens!  Well, to wrap this up in a way those who don't like reading will understand, (TL;DR:) 'Papers, Please' is a great game. Especially if you like paper.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Gameplay/Story: 5/5   Papers, Please is a very interesting game. Although at first glance you wouldn't think it, the story has quite a bit of depth and is very intriguing. The game revolves around a few factors; your own family's well being, other people's well being, the government you work for, as well as the rebellion group trying to take down said government. The game is riddled with sections where you must make decisions that will make some factors happy, and others not. Will you let the man's wife in even though she doesn't have her correct papers? Surely if you do, you would be betraying your country, which could result in you getting fined. That fine might make it impossible to feed your family that night. But this guy is a nice guy. Don't break their family apart. The social commentary is phenomenal, and the reoccuring characters such as Jorji make the story very memorable. The game has 20 endings and I'd recommend going for all of them.  Gameplay wise, the game is much more fun and addicting than you'd think. The entire game revolves around checking the entry papers of entrants wishing to cross the border. On the first few days, you check very few details in the passports of entrants. However, that very quickly changes as more and more factors, such as vaccines, entry permits, fingerprints, and contraband become relevant when deciding if someone may enter or not. The game gets hectic as you race againt the clock to ensure you earn the pay you need.    Design: 5/5    The game uses a pixel based design. That coupled with the very basic sound design may seem like a bad thing for most games, but in this case, it works excellently. It may seem ugly and repulsive at first, but eventually you'll fall in love with the entire style, as the graphics can be seen as part of the story as well.    Technical: 5/5    Papers, Please runs perfectly well. No glitches, no freezing. The game offers both full screen and windowed mode from launch which is great for short bursts of gameplay. The game allows for multiple save tracks. These save games are incorporated in a very cool way, allowing you to resume from any previous day while still creating a brand new track. The achievements all popped without issue.     Other Notes    -The achievement list, although short, allows you to play through the game in many different ways. I would recommend you try for them all, with that said, however, it is highly recommended that you play your first playthrough without any guides, simply make your own decisions for the best possible experience -Although replaying the story is fun, there is also an endless mode where you can just keep checking papers all day, every day. It is literally heavan.     Overall Rating: 5/5 - Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game brings me back to the time before all games did was physics engines and skyboxes, it has depth beyond the gameplay. Granted, the gameplay is mostly comparing data fields, and we made machines to do that for a reason, but the thing that makes this game grate is the underlying story.   The dialog is well made and even thou there is only as small pool of responses from the npcs, I still felt like they were individuals. The game is able to convey the feeling of living the life of the protagonist, which is remarkably rare in this day and age. I actually felt guilt at the end of the day when he couldn’t feed his family because I had not processed enough people, or when I had to send someone back to their death because their passport expired two days ago.  The game does have some flaws thou, and if you are a person that normally only plays shooters I would not recommend it.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please will definitely suprise you. Whatever you might think about a game in which your main goal is to stamp virtual papers, you're probably wrong. The premise of Papers, Please honestly doesn't sound like it would be very engaging. It sounds like work, and work just as boring as what most of us play games in order to escape and try to forget until the next morning when we have to go do it all over again. It doesn't seem like a game I'd be happy to have spent 11 hours playing so far. But. It is an excellent game.   There is more to this game than the mindless repetition of a dead end job. It takes attention to detail and quick thinking. You have to make decisions that will affect your and your family's survival in the long run. Choose to live in a better, more expensive apartment, and whether or not to buy food or heat for your household. Work with or against the rebels, or with or against the tightly run government of Arstotzka, or neither. Detain or simply deny entry to people with incorrect papers. Decide if your son deserves that gift he asked for on his birthday. And these decisions all lead to one of several different endings.   I can't recommend this game enough. It's great in its simplicity, and an interesting concept that I'm very glad someone decided to turn into an incredibly odd-sounding game. Go ahead and give it a shot. You'll like it.

Or maybe you are so hard coded on rules, that you won't let pass a girl, that one of the guards is in love, or your bosses lover (I guess, as she mentiones something about his endurance). Also how you follow the routine makes a difference - until you are forced to state a reason for the rejection, you can simply deny entry to anyone with missing documents without asking, or you might take some extra time to investigate, as they might be admissable after all.

Maybe have the year of the game be in the 2000 year and have more different ppl trying to get though or possibly have a co-op mode one plays as inspector and the other plays as the security guard of the checkpoint?  either way if they were to make a second one I'd be more than willing to invest in the game if that what it takes for them to make a new one. If you have any doubts then just simply look it up on youtube, it is worth a try and is fairly cheap.

Its more then just checking papers, like for instance, my good buddy Jorji comes up to me in the game and he says, 'Arstotzka is so great, who need pass port'. That gave me the giggle of my life. Me and him, we became buds. All Jorji ever wanted to do was sneak drugs and not be robbed the oppurtunity of over 9000 lulz and over 9000 smiles. Then there are the others like the watch dude. He came to me, I held his watch and he says 'Theres scratche! I want money back! What is your name?' Thats when I said 'HOW BOUT CHRIS HANSON FOR YA BUD CHRIS HANSON!' And then detained him. Point is that this game has made me have a phokin giigle and have Over 9000 denials, and over 9000 smiles as I pay the rent with my dead son in the apartment im trying to afford in the game.  All in all, I give this game 8/8 would no scope papers again m8",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I thought this game would be pretty bording from the description, but it is actually quite entertaining. There is a newspaper everyday for you to read before going to work the next day and it could range from what is going on to the county or to a serial killer on the loose (he may just show up at your booth). The game also has somewhat of a sense of humor with a guy coming up to you once every few days with what is probably the most hilariously done fake ID I have seen.

But thats as if you know what the hell to do all the time. Ive been playing it 7hr's+ and I still havent completed it. The endless mode is a good re-playbility feature. There is many twists and turns throughout the game, saving a relationship, stopping terrorist attacks, and helping an anti-goverment cult thing. It gets very intresting.

You shuffle the papers, try to keep your nose out of trouble so you may keep your job, and support a family including your wife, son, uncle, and mother-in-law. But along the way you have to make some moral choices, such as allowing a woman across the border to see her son, or allowing a woman to immigrate with her husband though she doesn't have the correct paperwork. This game is all about balancing being a decent human being and trying to save your own skin and that of your family's, who are depending on you. It's a test of what you'll do to help others, while also trying to help yourself. Get good enough at the game, and you may be able to do both.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","An absolutely unique and fantastic game. It creates an aura of tedium and monotony that is extremely engaging, and creates a unique and powerful experience. You have to deal with constantly changing regulations, need to maintain some level of accuracy to not get fined, yet you have pressure to pass as many people as possible through in order to feed your family. The game also makes you face countless moral dilemmas (accepting bribes, not allowing a husband to follow his wife due to missing a document, strip searching someone due to questionable gender), and really gives you a great amount of choice, with over 20 possible endings. I think starting the game is probably the hardest part, in that you are thinking 'am I really spending my free time validating hypothetical paperwork'? But I think once you get past those thoughts, you can immerse yourself into a very powerful and profound experience that is hard to find in gaming.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","You know, this is a f#cking weird game and I f#cking love it. I was not expecting myself to like it, but as usual, it has things that thick me off. As usual, I will start with those, so you know what to expect:  Now, being honest, I only found two things that caused trouble. The first of them is the limited space. 99% of the gameplay is spent comparing papers and looking if they’re legit, and to do so you have a desktop. The problem is that the desktop is small as hell. The thing is, I’m pretty sure this was made on purpose, but it doesn’t stop from being annoying. It also doesn’t help that when in fullscreen, the game has quite big black areas surrounding the game area, which do nothing and serve no purpose. The game could at least expand the window, instead of surrounding it with blackness and nothing... But then again, it's a game that you might as well play on Window mode.  The second thing that I didn’t like and caused trouble has to be with the graphics. The game is done in a pixelated style that suits it quite well, however when you have to compare photos to the people who hold them, those pixelated graphics backfire at times. A lot of times I got citations because “ID/Passport photo wasn’t the same” and crap like that when it was quite difficult to spot any difference! I ended up constantly checking them with the investigate option, and multiple times the game found differences I could just NOT spot by myself. It also doesn't help that the game bugs out at times and tells you that something matches or doesn't match when that's complete horse-sh#t and it looks like it would/wouldn't. Like the ID saying he's 1,55m tall and he seems to be nearly 2m tall, however the game will tell you that there's nothing wrong with those papers. It's hard to trust the game when crap like that keeps happening.  Lastly a third little problem, it’s not a game-breaking bug or anything, but rather an observation: You get paid by who many legit people get through. However, there are days when, I sh#t you not, only one or even no one was qualified to go through, meaning I didn’t get paid ANYTHING. That happened in two days already, and every time it happened I just restarted the day as with no pay, I would be pretty much screwed and forced to get a Game Over.  But besides that, what do you have left? A quite interesting interactive documentary about how sh#t the mid areas of Europe felt during the wars. And even though the countries in the game are fictional, they’re all based on actual countries.  The biggest point the game has running for it has to be the moral choices. It’s up to you who goes through and who doesn’t, and letting the right or wrong people in has consequences.  The audio is also good, fits quite well with the graphics. The main theme is catchy, and the rest of the game usually has ambient sounds with the made-up languages of the characters. Nothing stands out, which is good as it makes everything feel more or less natural.  The graphics, as I’ve said, have a few problems when it comes to the faces, but that being said they fit the game perfectly. Specially the still-images for what happens in special events.  The characters are also surprisingly well written, and could easily pass for real people. From corrupted douchelords to people who only want to survive, from soldiers who are forced to go through this sh#t everyday to jackasses like Jorji who are just lovable in every damn way.  Do I recommend this game? Yeah. It will put your brain to work, looking for what’s actually wrong with all those damn papers, while having a laugh or two with the current, rather sad events. The game also has, for what I know, around 20 or so endings, so that’s a good enough reason to play the game a few times. On a sale, this game is quite worth it for people who look for more casual and relaxing experiences.  TL;DR Edition: Relaxing game about people constantly trying to pass through a frontier with illegal drugs up their #sses. Well written and fun to play, it’s a good pick for any casual player who just wants to have a good time.  GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is absolutely everything I hoped it would be and more. It somehow manages to capture the drudgery of a repetitive, thankless job, the fear and scorn of those trying to get through a difficult border checkpoint and the hopeless, crushing despair of being unable to properly feed and care for your ailing family.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a brilliant indie game! Some indie games focus on light themes, but Papers, Please is quite dark and dreary.   Working as an inspection officer for Arstotzka, my job was to process entrants to Arstotzka. Some have forged documents and tickets/passes/cards but there was a lot more to look for.   Simply processing enough entrants to gain a decent salary was quite hard; the days were really quick! It took time to process each document and look for mistakes; besides, each applicant only gained you five credits. On top of that, there was the ever-present chance that you woulld slip-up, make a mistake, be handed an M.O.A. citation and lose those precious five credits. You needed every last dollar to pay for food, medicine, heat, etc.  The gameplay was surprisingly engrossing; this is one of the only games where I like its retro-style graphics; it really gives the feel of a Communist setting during the height of the Cold War in '82 (although in this world there may not be a Cold War).

What you have to do is check passports, ID's, work passes, and much more things to be successful in the game. If you fail at doing so, you will get a citation, but with no penalty. If you fail at checking passports three times, you will get a 5 credit penalty. If you fail 4 times, you will get a 10 credit penalty, and so on. It is worth it to buy it even if it is not on sale.

Interogate them over discrepancies and make a final accept/decline decision. Except there is some kind of secondary, invisable checkpoint that automatically finds ♥♥♥♥ ups and fines you. So one wonders why we are even here? More layers of beurocrazy are added over time (Passports, Permission to travel, Permission to ♥♥♥♥, Permission to use run on sentances...) until immigrants are handing you scrapbooking projects, and if they spelled their name with a different vowel once, then it is off to talk to the nice men. its hard to sympthathise as you get payed on a per passport total.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a very unique and entertaining game. Why is it unique? Because you play a role that is not often played in a game. A border guard in a corrupt communist country constantly dealing with forged documents and terrorist attacks. Additionally, the gameplay in general is not very common. Thoroughly inspecting papers and stamping them? Try and find another game that offers you that. Now, I know the idea of a game which has gameplay centering around basically doing paperwork doesn't sound very entertaining... but trust me on this one, it is.  Let me talk about the pros and cons of this game.  PROS: * Brilliantly written story * Interesting universe that you're always wanting to learn more about * Characters that you know little about and yet get invested in so quickly * Unique gameplay * Pixely but good graphics  CONS: * Slightly dull and boring gameplay * Fairly difficult gameplay * Jorji Costava  This game is definitely not for everyone. However, if you like things such as alternate history (especially communist timelines), games where you remain in one spot, and a game where the universe is likely the best part, Papers, Please is no-doubt for you.  Even if you feel like it's not aimed at you, give it a try. It's worth your money. I would highly recommend Papers, Please to anyone.  As for those of you who are too damn stubborn to try the game...  - The Ministry of Justice has become aware of your stubbornness and refusal to play Papers, Please. - You are under arrest for your horrible crimes. An investigation will follow your imprisonment. - Your family's safety is unknown. - Your Steam account will remain running under a replacement. - Glory to Arstotzka.  I'd give Papers, Please a 9/10. It certainly deserves that high of a score.",1,1

Sure, it is a tedium simulator, but it is anything but boring: the gameplay is engrossing, emotionally involving and requires a lot of attention to details, and the longer you play it the more challenging it becomes.  The Story mode has a great replay value, since there are many moral choices to be made and 20 endings to discover, and the Endless mode can keep you occupied for hours.

It starts out normal enough, stopping terrorist, letting in citizens, but then you start getting these hard choices that question your virtues as a human. Like for example, a man gets through the border with no problem, then tells you that his wife was in line behind him. His wife comes by, and has expired papers. So then what.. do you reunite the couple, and let your family go hungry that night? It feels like theres no in way to help both, so the bottom line is, what kind of person are you?

239030,"Papers, Please","I was introduced to this game through the most unlikely source I was asking people what's a great game to get during a Sale for Steam. I follow actor and indie game creator Wiley Wiggins he's known for his fantastic roll in Dazed and Confused. Well I asked him what was one game I should get on here for the sale and he told me 'You should get a indie game called Papers, Please' he gave me so many details about it I started to get intrested and man I made the correct choice. Not only is this game Terrific but it's also a very well thought out History lesson you'll but it and Study it, it has so much to offer yet the backround is sadly the truth I had to stop a few times to question and to think never has a game done that for me.

An interesting feature is the multiple endings, meaning every decision you made may be crucial to how the game plays out. I dislike that you can't tell what endings you have already achieved and have to restart from the beginning to work on a different path (it's easier than trying to find out where crucial moments happened because nothing on the 'episode' screens tell you exactly what major or minor events occured.

239030,"Papers, Please","Simple interface, simple graphics, simple enough way to explain how this game works. But it draws you in quick. It's a paperwork simulator, sure, but it's engaging and interesting. You are in charge of a border checkpoint and have to make sure only those meeting certain criteria are allowed in. If that were it, it would be fairly boring. But underneath it all, there's little things that affect how you play. Do you take a kickback to help pay for rent? How about saving up for your son's birthday? Do you let the person with expired documentation in, or send her back to her country where she will be killed?  It draws you in with the little stories. I don't think any other game has presented moral choices in a light such as this. Yes, you can do good and try to help people, but in doing so, you may be fined, and your family might starve. Do you show compassion and watch your family suffer, or do you protect your family, at the expense of being seen as the cold uncaring bureaucrat?",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please asks you a few interesting questions: after being assigned to man the border checkpoint what'll you do? Follow your corrupt and oppressive government laws by the letter or try and sneak a few poor souls in? Will you accept bribes? Will you try and help the rebels or just see how things pan out? How far will you go to make ends meet and ensure the safety of yourself and those you love?   PROS:   -despite sporting a minimalist art style the game graphics are convincingly bleak and oppressive   -simple yet catchy and appropriate music  -the game throws you several moral dilemmas, some decisions will give positive results, others won't change much while a few might be the end of you  -an engaging and branching storyline with a 20 different endings  -save system saves each day separately, you can also go back to a certain day and make different decisions thus generating a new save branch: this lets you experiment freely with the various outcomes  -smooth difficulty curve, new documents and rules are slowly introduced  -you'll get to meet interesting characters  -some examples of dry humor help balance the overall grim story  -having to correctly process enough entrants to ensure you have money to pay for rent, food, heating and surprise expenses really makes for a tense experience   CONS:   -since you're stamping documents and looking for discrepancies the gameplay is, by itself, pretty repetitive in nature  -some levels really throw alot of different documents and permits your way, making screening for discrepancies quite stressful (ofc this is a design choice)  -the simple graphics sometimes make spotting differences in facial features harder than it'd be   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457423093   Papers, Please ends up being a quite engaging experience: you'd easily be fooled by its straightforward gameplay but the truth is there's way more to it.

All things considered the best question the game asks is 'What kind of person are you?'. Your decisions and their outcomes will be the answer.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is a game that warrants a double take. When you first hear the concept it seems strange. A dystopian border patrol simulator. While at first the premiss of this game may disinterest many people browsing the large selection of games on steam. Trust me this game deserves your inspection. While its not your typical simulator it does a great job of putting you in the game's world. You are a citizen of a communist country called Arstotzka. Your name was pulled in a lottery for the job of the passport checker in the newly opened border of this imaginary country. The whole game is checking and double checking. The object is to either admit or dismiss as many people correctly in a limited amount of time. While this may seem repetitive at first its addictive. Whenever you start to feel bored of the gameplay they add a new twist or challenge to keep you busy. I have put a few hours and have only found one of the supposed twenty endings of this game. If you just want to play for the gameplay there is an endless mode for you to challenge yourself. For as simple as the story may seem it keeps you intrigued. The choices are everywhere. You are faced obvious options on such things as betraying the government, accepting bribes, or just helping people out. The atmosphere is immersive. After playing for a while you start to feel like a horrible dictator. The dark atmosphere and the things you have no control over provide surprising amounts of emotion. This is one of my favorite indie games of this year and am looking forward to more thing from the developer. I highly recommend buying it now or if you are a cheapskate nabbing it during a steam sale. GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is just brilliant. Not only is it more than worth the cost, but they have a free beta version (first some-odd levels) for download to see if you'd like it.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is a masterpiece in recreating the modern mundaity of work and its dehumanising effects on us in a modern era of targeted workflows and admin jobs. It managed to make me think about what a game can be , what my attitude towards my working life is and the hierarchies of families. The truly incredible thing is it achieved all this while still somehow managing to deliver a game experience that was still a game and most importantly, fun to play.  As a brief setup you play as a border agent processing applications for entry into your fictional eastern European country. You earn money for every applicant you process and you loose money for errors you make in processing.  You are made to care about you finances through a pretty simple set of systems. You have a family and you must feed them, heat them, keep them healthy and put a roof over their heads. It’s chest beating “MAN MUST PROVIDE FOR FAMILY” stuff at its most primal but it works pretty well. So well infact that pretty early on in my playthrough I realised that I had subconsciously cut my mother in law and uncle out of my family. After every days work the money was so tight I would rather save the $5 I had left incase of any issues down the line than to maintain my extended family in the form of the mother in law or uncle.  That is a pretty starling revelation to realise that a game has, without you even realising, made you think about your family hierarchy and who matters most in times of need. It’s a decision I don’t think many of us in the developed world have to make very often but it made me think of those who must have to face similar decisions on a more regular basis.  I have seen it argued that the family aspects of Papers Please don’t work that well as you are given no reason to care for them as they are just a line of text in a menu and you don’t have any real connection to them. I personally found this made the decisions I made in regards to family carry more impact. Family members were being presented as purely positions within a tree rather than characters with personalities that may have given me the basis to change my decisions. Whether that was a genuine design decision or just a function of a small team, it doesn’t really matter. The end result was powerful to me.  Fending for your family is the crux of the overall meta game and it provides plenty of purpose to the nitty gritty of processing applicants through your border but its in this processing that Papers Please really starts to shine.  Papers Please is an absolute masterclass in UI design. Some people will read that statement and think I have gone crazy. In an age of sleek flat UI an initial glance at Papers Please would lead you to think it’s a complete mess. But that’s the point.  I work in a office that focuses solely on the processing of applications. My work day used to comprise of a pile of applications with attached supporting documents that I would then workthrough to deem eligibility for the product we sold.   It was always a complete mess and there was never enough room to see everything you needed to make a decision at once. We then moved to a document scanning system and went paper free. This made desks empty but increased the workflow clutter tenfold. A screen can only show so much info at a time and our system only let you view one page at a time. It was slow, frustrating and you always felt like something was in the way of you seeing the whole picture as just that, a whole.  Papers please simulates this whole feeling perfectly with its UI. Nothing is automated. For you to receive documents you have to manually pick them up from your counter and arrange them on your workspace which is just a small window in your real life monitor. There is never enough room and documents overlap constantly meaning you always struggle to feel truly efficient.   As the days progress and more rules are added to qualify for entry the space just gets less and less and every single additional pressure requires you to manually perform a new action. Not sure on a persons ID? Finger print them, manually hand them the slip, manually check it, manually stamp the passport manually pass them each of their 5 documents one at a time. It sounds like a nightmare but it isn’t and it makes me realise something about our real life working day.  People love a rhythm, we like to see repetition because it confirms we know what is happening. Papers Please shows that even when a task is relatively mundane, as long as it has a certain rhythm and you can feel yourself getting better at it over time, there is enjoyment to be had.  I genuinely started off slightly stressed playing Papers Please. I was constantly worried about cash and if I was processing enough applicants. Given time though I improved and realised I could afford to support my family (minus those tag alongs). Its right about that time when Papers Please starts to show its narrative head and you realise there is slightly more going on here than at first glance.  I won’t ruin specifics as they are some of my favourite moments in the game but you start to see some people at your border control more often than others and each of these people have their own set of requirements from you. It starts off with simple things such as a request to let a wife through (she doesn’t have the right docs) but over time more nefarious requests start to be made that have story consequences for the whole of your nation.  These serve to break up the processing of applications very well and they give the whole game a narrative thread from day one through to the end. They also serve as branching points to give the game around 20 different endings. Ive currently seen about six and there is some good variety in there.  It’s in these character interactions that I started to think about how much a job can dehumanise us. There are people trying to get through my border that will have zero nefarious intent. They simply have a document that is one day out of date. It doesn’t matter though because they never get put through by me. In a real world situation I would probably ruin lives by taking such a hard line approach but the paycheck justifies some pretty inhumane actions in Papers Please. Papers Please made me think about how many people in real jobs will take the same justification home with them every night.  Stylistically Papers Please is also a success. It plays on our preconceptions of eastern Europe in some pretty nice ways. The colour pallet is muted. The music is stereotypical of what we would expect and there is plenty of nationalist imagery. The game over screen even proclaims GLORY TO ARSTOZKA! I’ve never been to eastern Europe so I’ve no idea if any of this hits the nail on the head but it certainly matches our preconceptions of 1980s eastern Europe.  Papers Please is a rare game and a game that could only exist in this modern self publishing world we seem to be in now. It’s a measure of how far gaming has come as a medium that a game that simulates a mundane job can be so high on so many people game of the year lists.  In previous years a risk such as Papers Please would never have been taken. A singular creators vision had nothing but barriers to overcome if they wanted to get to market. This is no longer the case and I hope Papers Please is the first of many games in the coming years that subvert our expectations as to what a game is.  Ultimately, and this is going to sound pretentious, I think Papers Please could prove to be one of the first stepping stones that lets us make strides towards games loosing the tag “game”. The medium can be so much more than the play thing the title “games” suggest and Papers Please proves that.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","There are so many reasons why Papers Please is so appealing. It's got a typical BioWare plot, which means that there's a mystery that's so well thought out and told that everything clicks into place during the big reveal. Yet it's also a game made by sci-fi fans for those who love sci-fi. There are so many elements borrowed and culled from decades of science fiction and movies, and there are countless moments that will remind you of Star Trek or Aliens or Firefly or some early John Carpenter movie (the electronic score is very Carpenter-esque, too). There's even an effective film grain post-processing effect that makes the game feel like a 70s or 80s sci-fi movie, before digital filmmaking and CGI made everything look and feel too clean.  Here's the premise of Papers Please: Several hundred years in the future humanity has joined the galactic community after finding alien technology on Mars that opens up interstellar travel. We uppity humans are seen as too ambitious in a galaxy run by a UN-like council populated by ancient alien races. You play as The Inspector of the human Alliance military, and BioWare lets you role-play as either a male or female character. There are pre-rolled characters that you can select or you can create a custom character with a unique face.  When a rogue spectre--one of the galactic council's special agents--attacks a human colony on Eden Prime, you're tasked with hunting him down. It's not that simple, though, as invariably epic themes such as extinction on a galactic scale kick in. So you must zip around the galaxy in a very sleek starship, explore alien worlds, engage in futuristic firefights, and unearth the overarching mystery. There's also a cast of human and alien characters that can grow on you, like Wrex, a krogan killing machine with a blunt, sardonic personality. And this wouldn't be a game without one or two romance possibilities, as well.",1,0

Or send the wife of the man you just let through to her doom because of a number mismatch?  It acts as a great example of a nation led by machine-men, setting rules to (attempt to) keep numbers in check, leaving it to others to face the people it affects.  Gameplay is basically going through papers, checking for discrepancies. New rules are piled on you as previous rules failed to completely prevent incidents of letting the wrong people in. Pressure is on you as you're paid by the stamps, not by the hour. And the rent's just gone up, the heat had to be cut, your son is sick, GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I took a leap of faith when I decided to purchase Papers, Please. It's a game I heard great things from but never really appealed to me when I saw some footage of the game. When the game won the Community Voter's Choice during the Steam Holiday Sale I decided to see if my $5 would be a good investment for something new. I'm happy to report that Papers, Please not only impressed me, but turned out to be one of the most addictive and intelligent games I've ever played. Papers, Please is a game that puts you in the role of a border patrol agent. Your task is to take passports from many incoming immigrants and citizens and either allow or deny them access to the dictatorship that is Arstotzka. The people you meet all have varied personalities and some are more patient than others. The game challenges you as you constantly have to review information for any discrepancies that you may find. This may result in invalid gender, issuing city, or an false identity. Even more so is many of your clients will come to you and beg for entry or bribe you so they can access the country and not delay their plans. Your role is to ofcourse, make money. You have to survive but also take care of your family which consists of your son, mother-in-law, uncle, and wife. These people can get sick, hungry or cold. You'll have to balance your money and choose whether to feed your family, turn on the heat, or give your sick family member medicine before they die. There is also a conspiracy theory going on deep within the city. Some people you meet will be secret agents, government officials, or members from a dark old organization. This game will challenge your moral standpoint as you'll have to decide whether you can trust someone or whether the person who's supposed to be someone, really is that person. The game will take up more time than you'd expect but will constantly challenge you and pull you into it's well crafted gameplay. Papers, Please is truly a game that you'll get value out of. It will make you question your morals and make you feel the emotional weight of your every decision.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I have just discovered that game and I'm not quite sure what makes it great. Is it the fact that you deny entrance to your country to poor people who have nowhere else to go? Is it the fact you strive to earn enough money to feed your family and always seem to fail? Perhaps. Or not. If I had been told that checking passports, I.D cards and work permits was so much fun, I would have studied to become a border guard.  The game depicts in an extreme but humorous way, a communist country which has recently re-opened its borders. You have just won the work lottery. Congratulations, you are one of the only ones to have an actual job now. You still won't be able to pay the rent or feed your family, but at least, you have work!  The game in itself is very smart, the difficulty increases slowly but surely. You must verify the expiry dates, check all documents, the gender, weight, height, passport number, diplomatic seals, issuing cities, etc. Once in a while, events occur and the policies change. You dismantle bombs, get extra earnings by shooting at people or detaining them. Sometimes, you even get 'special' visits. With about 20 different endings, this game is as deep as it can be while remaining 100% entertaining.",1,0

The world they have created is immersive and the characters throughout have compelling reasons (both good and bad) why they should be let through the checkpoints.

The decisions you make may impact how far you make it in the game, as deviating from your job description can land you in jail (and end this game short).

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a terrific puzzler developed by Lucas Pope. You work as an inspector for an Arstotzkan border and have to check all of their papers to be sure they are valid for entry.  The graphics of the game are extremely simplistic, lovable and eye catching. After every day, you get to see how your family is doing and have to buy food and/or heat for them. There are many interactions you can have with your family, such as your son having a birthday and you buying a gift for them. Leaving them without food or heat for too long will eventually kill them, but hey, less mouths to feed and warm.  Sometimes, there are terrorist attacks and you must stop them with your tranquilizer. You get a bonus for this. Also, while we're on the topic of terrorists, an infamous group called EZIC will contact you during the game. You will get bonuses from them, and a few of the endings revolve around EZIC. You do not have to do all of what EZIC tells you to do, but it's more enjoyable (in my opinion) following them.  You can upgrade your booth for easier inspecting. Some of the upgrades include pressing tab to open your stamps, space to check their papers for discrepencies, etc.  While there is fun moments, the discrepency detector can be a bit buggy, which could kill the fun. I think overall, Papers, Please is a terrific game and if you have the money lying around do get it.   9.5/10   (Jorji lives!)",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of the most Indie game ever you see (and funny).   In the year of October 1982, you have won the October labor lottery and your name was pulled. For immediate placement, report to The Ministry of Admission at Grestin Border Checkpoint. An apartment will be provided for you and your family in East Grestin. Expect a Class-8 dwelling.  You play as the Inspector, which of course you are working as a border inspector. Your job is to check their passport to make sure no expiration date, issuing city, name, picture, passport number and gender. By the time the day keeps going, there will be more papers which makes it harder to organize and match.  For stamping, 'Approved' if all of the passport and papers are organized and good to go, 'Denied' if some of the passport and papers are not match, forgery or false information. If you make 'Approved' stamp, but saw something that is wrong, you can do second stamp for 'Denied' or go for 'Discrepancy Detected' to 'Detain' them that it does count for that.  The citation warning will bring up what you did wrong. The first two you won't get penalty, but third and more will receive 5 credits penalty each.  There are multiple endings to choose from. Working with EZIC, brainwashed from Arstotzka, freedom, sacrifice, etc.  For me, it kinda feels relaxing and pretend to be working as an inspector which makes a whole lot of sense when I go to the airport or crossing border. Even though, I would get bribed by someone, but I wouldn't do that because the ministry won't like it (as in the game). =P  Overall, I give it 8.5/10 for this game.

239030,"Papers, Please","It's hard to describe what's so fun about Papers, Please. To put it simply, the game is about checking the documents of people trying to cross a fictional Eastern Bloc nation's border with ever-changing rules and procedures. It's an oppressive environment as you're constantly choosing between strictly enforcing the rules of your superiors, or bending them at your own expense to do what seems right. You can have people detained for cash. You can take bribes. Everyone seemingly has a story or excuse for their discrepancies. And all the while, the rest of your family is starving and cold because you can't afford food and heat.  But it is fun! It's so fun. It's almost entirely mouse-driven, but everything feels perfect. You move the documents onto your desk for closer inspection. Stamping papers makes a satisfying 'kachunk' sound. Upgrades to your interface bring shortcuts. There's a time limit to each day, and you get paid by the person processed, with fines for screwing up (either intentionally or unintentionally) more than twice. It moves pretty briskly but once I got a rhythm down, I never really felt oppressed by the clock. Everything just works great. I got about five of the 20 endings, and I will probably go back to see if I can find the rest.   Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' is a fun puzzle game set around the unlikely theme of a Communist border control post. As the border guard for Arstotzka you are under pressure from the authorities to accurately process entrants according to ever-changing criteria, whilst juggling your meagre salary to keep yourself and your family alive. As your pay is linked to processed entrants, you have to push through as many as possible without making mistakes; mistakes are deducted from your pay. A stream of entrants queues outside your booth, meaning you only have a few seconds to make a decision - yes or no - on each. Will you help through the refugee without papers? Will you take a bribe? Will you help a dissident?  I love the grey, bleak 1984-esque world of Arstotzka and how, as a minor official, you find out about changes through the state newspaper and visitors to your booth.

Set in a foriegn European country, you are set with the task of approving and rejecting people into your homeland of Arstotzka. You get paid per correct citizen you allow in, and you get penalized for every mistake you make. The rules and regulations the country gives you makes the game more and more challenging. At the end of each day, (level) you are given your pay, but you also have bills. The food, heat, and rent expenses pile up. Often leaving you to not pay for one, leaving your child, wife, and uncle either cold or hungry. Or both. This game challenges your morals. Do you let the young wife into Arstotzka to be with her husband? Or do you reject her becuase of a missing work permit and follow orders? There seems to be only one music track in this game that plays when you start it up, and at the end of each day. While the music track is good, I would like more. But on the other hand, the lack of music during the actual gameplay makes it seem all the more realistic. The graphic style of this game is quite good.

239030,"Papers, Please","Well, this game was kind of sitting on my wishlist so one day I figured I would get it to see what everyone is liking about it, first i'll say this, for a simple game it holds a heII of a lot of weight on it.  PROS:  Story: The story is a little simple, you are a man who got a job at a border controll station into Arstotzka, some kind of Russian like country, you're job is to make sure that whoever doesn't have their paper work in order gets a 'Denied' stamp, and who has it correct gets a 'Approved' stamp.  Money: You have to get money to care for your family, your son, father, wife, and *shiver* 'Mother-in-law', how it works is every Deny you make you get paid, every Approve you make you get nothing (least I think you do), so you want to clear as many of those people as you possibly can.  Paperwork: Yes, this game is basically a paper-work simulator, but it's a heII of a lot more than just that, theres a whole background network of stuff that happens, organizations wanting in, other countries Arstotzka can't trust, democrats who could be possible terrorists.  Characters: The characters you meet are a little weird at first, like a guy who wants into Arstotzka but doesn't have the right paper work on him, or a woman who wants to go through the checkpoint cause her husband went first but she doesn't have the paper work to be allowed in, or the organization who wants into Arstotzka with their spies to see what's going on, choices you have to make and could have consequences.  Choices: Throught your one/many playthroughs you'll have to have some choices, whether it be help or disregard the Organization, not or let the husbands wife through the checkpoint regardless to be nice, let that little d%$khead through even though you REALLY don't want to cause of how annoying he can be. Be careful with what you decide to do, because one wrong move can mean you lost the whole game. Honestly at times when I had to pick choices I was kind of scared, I was afraid of what the outcome would be, and since i'm on a timer I have to be very careful about what I picked.  Paperwork/What Civies need: When you start off in the game, it's simple, every Arstotzkan is allowed in if they have the right passport, everyone else isn't allowed in, but later on the paperwork just starts piling up like crazy. Permission to come in Arstotzka, permission to work, permission to go through, permission to go to the bathroom, permission to walk, permission to talk, it starts to get annoying at times, but after a while you start to notice errors in documents without so much as even blinking or going to the handbook. But every once in a while even I end up screwing up the simplest of things.  Pay attention to details: What I mean by this is you need to look at every little detail about the paperwork, the names of people, passports, expiration dates, the stamps, the city and district names, the persons height, their weight, their gender, EVERYTHING, don't overlook anything, if you think it's fine check it anyway, you'd be surprised. Cause if the person misspells their name just once then it's off to the guys with guns and they go into the building people go into but don't come out of so much.  Discrepency machine: This machine is basically a analysis tool and I like it a lot, say it's hard to read the screen and you can't tell if the persons name on the passport matches their entry permit or work permit, you hit SPACE BAR or click the button on the bottom right, click one name, then the other, it scans it for any errors and if it's clean you are fine, if it's a discrepency then a icon appears over the little 'Talk machine' and you click on it (without going out of the discrepency machine) and it asks the person a question to whatever it was you scanned, sometimes you need to do fingerprints, others it may be a search.  Upgrades: Your booth ends up getting upgrades that you can pay for, they aren't big, they are a little simple, like for the handbook for rules and country city names you have to manually flip through the pages, later you can buy a upgrade which gives it 'tabs' so you just click on the tab and get sent to the area you clicked whether it be rules or stamp symbols, or the deny/approve slider, instead of clicking it you get a upgrade where you hit TAB and it comes out automatically, hit TAB again to put it back, and for the discrepency machine you hit SPACE BAR to bring it up, and SPACE BAR again to put it away.  CONS:  The Citation Error Machine: I hate this f#$ker with all of my heart and soul, I call this thing the 'F#$k Up' machine, because everytime you f#$k up, it makes this irritating noise and comes up saying what you missed or didn't look over, and after a while I sometimes want to just throw my monitor out of the damned window. Yes it's annoying but atleast it tells you what you missed or didn't look at, good job Arstotzka, I feel great that a machine can do my job better and yet it's free. This thing is basically a invisible scanner, on the way out of the checkpoint it scans the person for if they had everything correct or something wrong and tells you what it was.  Endless Mode: This isn't in the cons section because it sucks, it's a little fun actually, especially if you play the Papers, Please theme while you do so, you can pick what you want to do and how much paperwork is required to pass, but honestly after a while it can get a little dull, what I think they should have done is put some kind of randomized game in, where you pick how much paperwork is required but you don't know what could happen, the guards could all die from a terrorist or something if you accidently pushed someone through who had incorrect permits or something, seriously, would add a lot of replay value.  Easy game overs: I only beat 1 of the 20 endings that there is but you need to be very careful about what you do SPOILER ALERT, at one point if you let one of the Organizations spies in you get 1k, yes, 1 thousand bucks, but if you keep it and don't use it or something the government takes it and puts you in jail, as well as your family members. Another time was I had to let this d*$khead advisor for the checkpoint, make me let a woman through yet she wasn't supposed to, and I forgot the woman's name so I ended up putting her in jail, then I got ANOTHER game over, and it gets annoying to have to resort to previous days and go through ALL the work again and try not to let the f$%k up machine go off just to get to a certain point.  WHAT I THINK: I think this game is something very special, it's so simple yet so amazing all at once, 'EA would never make something like this, infact it would probably remind them of their Customer Support Services.' = Yahtzee Croshaw. All and all though, it gets a damn good 9/10, minus the f$#k up machine and some things I think would have enhanced the game, it's pretty damn good, but i'm sure after you get all of the endings it could get a little dull. This game is totally worth it as it sits and when it's on a sale.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is great. It has nice gameplay and pixellated graphics that enhance the experience. Complete with moral choices, clear conflict, and amazing story. This game is a wonderful experience and is definitely worth the ten dollars.  7/10. Highly recommended.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I was actually very surprised by how immersed I was in this game. I bought it on a whim because it was in the autumn sale and I heard some things about it so I thought, 'Why not?'. You start the game off and listen to the really catchy music with the title going slowly upwards as it bobs to the rhythm of the music. I thought the music was also very thematic as well, telling me the kind of setting I would be playing in, so that's a plus.   Okay, then I started a new game and, at first, it starts up kind of slow, showing me what to do and how to use the certain controls in the game. I'll get back to that in a bit, though. But just as I as getting bored with the game, thinking that it was becoming repetitive, it started to add story elements. On any random day the border can be attacked by a terrorist bomber or a group of them kill all the guards around the border and its up to you to take them out. And then there is also a secret organization that tries to get you to help them with their cause.   It was all of these things that kept me interested in the game, more immersed. I really couldn't stop playing it because I wanted to see what happened next, if something even happened next. Well, I guess I also got a sense of satisfaction of being given the power to dictate whether a person can enter or not. Anyway, I thought it was a really good game, very creative because of its unique gameplay and style that it gave me. Plus, it also multiple endings! So you have tons of replayability if you're done with the first playthrough.   I do have a complaint though. I just kind of thought that one of the upgrades was kind of useless. Like the 'double click to use inspection mode'. There was already another upgrade to activate it with the spacebar so I didn't think there was any need for that upgrade. I'm not sure what could've been in place of that but I'm sure that the creator could've thought of something. I would say the same thing about the book shortcuts but I found those useful so I'll leave that one be.   Other than that, I had a great time playing the game. It required me to be real attentive and I think it actually helped increase my perception because sometimes there is just one tiny thing that you can overlook and you can get a citation for it. So you have to really pay attention to the dates, genders of the people, serial numbers, and even the cities in the passports that they're using. Sometimes they try to trick you with that so be careful. Also the dialogue with the characters can sometimes feel very natural so that is another aspect that can immerse you into the game.   Now, Papers, Please definitely won't be the most exciting game you would ever play but it will pull you in with its unpredictability, interesting setting, and very intuitive gameplay mechanics. So if you're in the market for a PC game I highly recommend Papers, Please. If you are on the edge of whether or not to buy this, do it. You won't be disappointed with it at all, and it's only 9.99 so it's a really good price for what you get with this game.   My rating for Papers, Please is a 9/10",1,0

I'd say it's the most entertaining and unique game I've come across in a long time and I'll be replaying it several times in the future just to see all the endings and really explore the full storyline. One final note is that this game can be quite difficult at times playing on normal mode. For me, usually the only thing that gets my family by day by day is taking bribes from people at the cost of a demerit. You want to do your best in this game and save those two warning demerits per day for bribes and other activities that require you to do illegal things. I haven't played on easy mode yet but I might just to see how it is to have disposable cash and afford stuff I haven't been able to afford like adopting my niece. You get 20 free credits a day supplement in easy mode. But I thouroghly reccommend playing on normal first just to get into the stressfull atmophere of poverty and experience the sadness when you can't afford a gift for your son's birthday. On the other hand: I didn't really mind. This is ♥♥♥♥ing Arstotzka. You know we're freaking poor as poo so why you asking me for such a damn expensive crayon set. 20 credits? What the hell, son. You really set yourself up for dissapointmen. 'Here, I have crayon for you, son. I make it from wax and my tears. Draw proud Arstotzkan soldier beating papa up for accidentally admitting Obristani terrorist what killed 2 guards and stole many, many turnips from Arstotzkan turnip reserve. Now eat that crayon!'

Also, the gameplay itself is surprisingly tough, with you having to pay attention to each and every detail, and rather than chucking everything at you at once and overwhelming you, it slowly adds more and more pieces of paperwork and rules, so you have plenty of time to understand each one before you have to learn a new one.",1,0

Of course it's never really that simple. Everyday, from my little booth, I've had to make decisions that could affect people's entire lives. It's weighed pretty heavily on my own life, and possibly more so on my family's. It's been incredibly stressful, and I've done some pretty dark things. I've seen innocent people taken away, I've stolen and taken bribes, I've even killed. But what else could I do? I had people counting on me. Tensions built and something terrifying was brewing in my country - in the end I did what I had to to protect my family.

239030,"Papers, Please","First of all, this game is depressing.  It puts you in the boots of a poor paper pusher at a border-checkpoint of a dictatorship(ed?) country .   While you are struggeling to keep your family fed and warm, you are deciding over human lives in a always shorter timeframe. Why this? The faster you check the immigration papers of people seeking refuge, the more money you earn each day. But if you make mistakes you can loose money as well. This gets harder every day as the administration releases more and more rules and admittances for you to check. At the same time the game throws you into some moral decisions, where there is no right or wrong. Do I turn down the human-trafficer, although his papers are ok? This could lead to a fine and I could not afford the medicine for my son. Do I take the bribe from the nice man claiming to smuggle medicin for his sick wife?  As I said... this game is depressing. Would I recommend you to buy and play it?  Yes!   Because this game manages something only few games manage to do. To get you involved and question your own morality.

The best way to describe it is working in Stalin's DMV, sifting through enough papers throughout a day to make a redwood tree flinch in horror. Unique gameplay itself is more than enough to give Papers, Please a look, but what really makes the game pop is its story. Everyone has problems, and you are no exception.

239030,"Papers, Please","I just bought (for a mere $4.99, btw - another reason I absolutely *love* 'indy games') a game called 'Papers, Please'. Very original, innovative... 'different'. Very 'detective-esque'. I like it a lot.   You play as a border checkpoint guard in a cold-war era sovietesque fictional country called 'Arstozka' (surrounding countries are fictional, as well) to process immigrants and citizens entering the country. The reasons are numerous - allegedly for work, permanent move, visiting parents, children, marriage, passing through, etc. You are the sole decision-maker as to their 'Approval' or 'Denial' (of which you literally stamp one way or the other).   The game starts off simple enough... immigration controls are very loose to start, and you just need to ensure that their passports don't have any discrepancies. Over time terrorists start to attack the border, and other things happen throughout society / the economy that 'dictate' immigration reform, with immigration controls becoming more and more strict. This necessitates more and more paperwork (and other 'controls' and so-called 'random searches') needed to be approved for entering the country, and of course more potential for discrepancies...  But that's not just it. You get paid based on how many people you 'process' in a given time (or 'work day'). They allow a few 'violations' on your part to pass through as 'warnings', but after too many violations, you get penalized by losing part of your money.  The other issue is that your family relies on your salary to survive. They need food, heat, payment for rent, and sometimes medicine. There are also upgrades you can pay for to make your job more efficient or easier, potentially allowing you to 'process' more people at the checkpoint. You can accrue savings, for what purpose I'm not quite sure yet (it looks like maybe you can pay to have more of your family brought over and given passports for a 'better standard of living').   If you're not careful, and if you're not efficient enough, you may not have enough money to pay all your bills. You need to make choices as to what to pay for and what to forego. Family members can die, or with sufficient delinquency on your part, you get sent to the gulags and lose the game.  Moral and ethical dilemmas pop up frequently - with regards to your family, choices on who to save and who to let go cold or hungry or even die, and other ethical dilemmas surrounding the people trying to enter the country.   The music is very cold-war sovietesque, which is fitting as something akin to East Germany during the Soviet era. The graphics, in wonderful indy fashion, are delightfully retro and charming.  Very interesting, indeed. I definitely recommend it! For $5, the cost of a Starbucks Latte, it's totally worth it.  Glory to Arstotzka!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QP5X6♥♥♥♥M",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Games provide us with systems and ask us to master them. We learn to jump at the right time, hit the mark, ask the right question in the dialogue tree, navigate the maze, push the block, kill the enemy.   On the surface, Papers, Please is a game with novel mechanics about document examination. You play the role of a border control agent who must ensure that everyone's papers are up to date, authentic, and match the immigrant. You are given a rule book and are asked to highlight problems with the papers by matching up a rule to an offending line or image. In a couple of clicks, you tease out contradictions, stamp the passport Denied, and call for the next and the next.  As the game rolls along, new wrinkles and rules appear and the documents become more complex. The faster you work, the more salary you take home to care for your family, so it behooves you to master the mechanics and become an expert agent who doesn't make mistakes and processes the line impartially.  Over time, you come to realize that the game is asking more of you. It puts you in situations where it could be wrong to follow the rules you have invested so much time to learn. To deny the passport of someone's loved one. To take a bribe. To look the other way for a local official. To detain people for money.  In other words, the game asks you, in a way I found very emotionally honest, to stop playing so well.  The first time through, I did my best to follow all the rules in the book, for good or bad. I played the role of a faceless functionary. It was mechanical in every sense of the word. But the second time through, I let my conscience be my guide. To my surprise, things played out very differently.  This is the best trick of Papers, Please. It makes you uncomfortable to play.

As you get paid based on the number of people you screen, you are forced to work fast. Make too many mistakes, however, and you receive citations resulting in your salary getting docked. You become indoctrinated to dread the fax noise that comes with every citation. Your family lives on the edge of poverty and you are forced to budget accordingly.  As the government relaxes or strengthen their policies, your job changes with it, where the foreigner who was let in a day earlier may not be today, which allows for some essential variation to prevent the game from becoming stagnant. This comes in the form of detention of criminals, fingerprint and X-ray scanning and seal verification.  The game also does a good job questoining your morality. For instance, do you allow the guy with good documentation pimp in Arstotzka, or deny him and get reprimanded by your superiors? Do you buy food for your starving uncle or a present for your son's birthday?  Papers, Please is an indie game done right, in which it is not a pretentious, bland game that boasts of subtle depth while being ♥♥♥♥ to play, nor is it another 'retro styled' hardcore platformer. It is a unique game that manages to tackle heavy morality issues while still being amusing to the player.  Two thumbs up!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is not a game you have 'fun' with. It's a very bleak tale about the nature and abuse of power, the burden of knowledge, and above all, hope. The gameplay, which escalates throughout the story into more and more of an intellectual challenge, is a vehicle for the game to toy with your emotions. The choices you make have a wide range. Should I arrest the old woman for having false information on her passport? If I do, I will get a bonus that may well mean affording medicine for my wife. But then again, the old woman is hardly responsible for what is likely a typo made by an immigration officer as fallible as you. Should I listen to the mysterious revolutionaries? On one hand, they may bring about a better world; on the other, I may well end up under arrest along with my innocent family. Should I accept the bribe from the man who claims to be just smuggling harmless medicine for a friend? These are the kind of choices that I would impulsively make, knowing I had to process more people to make enough money, and then ponder over for the next fifteen minutes, turning the moral dilemna over in my head.

239030,"Papers, Please","While Papers, Please is at its core a micromanagement game (maybe the closest comparison is 'a really brutal Diner Dash'), it's thematically like no game you've ever played. Set in a fictional Soviet country in 1982, the player has 'won the Labor Lottery' and is permanently assigned as the sole border inspector on the country's war-won political border.  You recieve new and increasingly limiting instructions from an ineffective bereaucracy, double check for forged documents, earn a bare wage that forces you to choose between medicine for a sick son or food for your whole family, have work days cut short by suicide bombers-- and even man a sniper rifle when security staff is cut short.  The game's strength is in the brutality of its presentation. It's all dark humor painting a surprisingly nuanced picture of the Cold War era, of immigration, of third-world countries, of governments; but altogether never overdoing it, or even tongue-in-cheek. The game's strength is that everything it needs to communicate is effectively communicated through gameplay.  Papers, Please is a really tremendously unique game that should be owned for the experience. It's ♥♥♥♥ed up in all the best ways, and, let's not forget, is the most entertainment I've ever gotten out of forced bureaucratic paperwork in all my life.

239030,"Papers, Please","So you are a borders control officer in this simple looking game.  To begin you are checking passports - yeah that guys face matches his picture, passport number mhm... simple enough. Daily you are assigned new tasks, soon immigrants require further paperwork which all must be checked and stamped so you know it isn't a forgery. Then they require proof of vaccines as polio hits the country... then there are faces of the country's most wanted you must watch out for as well as doing your job.  The game becomes a test of your scrutiny and vigilance towards the documentation and dialogue as you approve or decline individuals and hope as you call 'next' that a little print out doesn't appear on your desk telling you why the last person's checks were incorrect.  You are monitored!  To add further problems, you encounter various characters coming through your booth. There is the chap who seems nice enough with his hand drawn passport but no you cannot just let through anyone! Then there is the guy who dumps a bomb at your window! Then there is the ever elusive order. It is up to you how you deal with this vigilante group. Do you support them with their promises to keep you safe or do you maintain your honesty and deny them their requests. At the same time there is corruption and you are ordered by your superiors to let certain individuals through against the rules.  At the end of every day you go home with whatever scrapings you made from bribes, rewards and efficiency at your work. You can save money by denying your family heat and food but they will get sick and you must pay for medicine.  This game for whatever reason is addictive!

Having worked in admin before make me realise it's easier when you've done this kind of focused examination of documents to ensure the people have everything they need.   Pre-scripted events like terrorism, bombs, a secret government organisation, bribes from applicants, favours from officials appear to make you question the orders you receive from above, along with potential opportunities to give your family a better home.

Do you turn away someone desperate to escape a terrible situation because his passport expired a day ago? Do you invade a person's privacy to determine their sex?

239030,"Papers, Please","A glance at Papers, Please might cause someone to think 'Why would anyone want to play a game about checking for errors in documentation? That sounds like a job.' But if there's anything that we can learn from simulation games is that they don't have to be fun to draw you in, because once you find that each document is a window into a person's private life, and that you are reluctantly given the tough decision 'Should I let this person into my country?', you find that there is a dangerously comfortable flow.  This game confronts you with sequences of people who provide you documentation for immigrating to the ficticious country Arstotzka (based on the Soviet Union). You must carefully search their documents for errors and make sure that everything is in order before letting them in. But the genius behind this game soon becomes apparent. You have limited time, and the more people you let into the country before the end of the day, the more money you get. What do you need money for? Well, you have a large nuclear family who all rely on your income to take care of heating, food, medicine, and you will never be able to afford all of these things.   But you can't just let in everyone, because every time you permit a person with incorrect documentation to enter, you receive a citation, and eventually get docked pay. This creates a wonderful tension between wanting money and not loosing your job. And checking documents isn't easy, it's often tedius to compare spelling of names, or social security numbers, or expiration dates, or remembering what type of identification each person should be having, so making mistakes is a matter of a keen eye and a good memory for rules.   To make it even harder, you only have a third of the screen to place documents, so you can never see all of them at a time. But that wouldn't be stressful enough, because each person often has a story and in such a dystopian world, you find people who empathize with, but have bad documents, or people who are evil but have everythign in order. And the game will often send you reminders of decisions you made that ruined someone's life, or sometimes saved it.  And on top of all of this there is a plot about a group of revolutionaries who try to recruit you to their cause. And with the horrible bureaucracy you see around you, the revolutionaries have a good point, but you must decide whether to risk helping them, or to play it safe with a government that will hopefully leave you and your family alone.  What all this adds up to is a game that causes you to have to make the decisions that people in stressful bureaucratic jobs must make. In a way it forces you to begin to think more openly about why people at the DMV seem unhappy, or even show us how people in an authoritarian government may seem heartless, but are really trying to protect their family.  So purchase this game for your own education, if not for its compelling and intricate gameplay.  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an exciting game where you are playing as an volunteered inspector in a fake Communist country called Arstotzka after a six year war with Kolechia. Because of this you may experience a terrorist attack if a Kolechian passes. The game feels real and when I play it I feel like its really my duty to make sure everybody passes the border correctly without making any mistakes. What makes it feel more realistic is how you don't forget you have a family and you have to take care of them by making sure they are healthy, they have food to eat, and you have to buy things for their birthday. Even if you do have a crappy computer/laptop you can still play this game because you aren't moving around or going anywhere. The graphics are in 8 bit so that makes it better if you have a bad computer. You sit at a desk and make sure people pass the border without flaws. In some parts of the game you may have to go back levels which isn't very happy to find out, but it just made the game better for me. And even though sometimes you may be a bit low on cash you can turn on easy mode and earn an extra 20 bucks a day/level. Also, the music in this game makes it even more fun and playable.

239030,"Papers, Please","What kind of person am I?  I like to think I’m loyal to my friends, as honest I can possibly be, hardworking and generous. Everything I keep around in my life seems to point to those things to some degree. I’ve had the same friends since elementary school, I try to be as upfront as possible even when it can knock me down, I get consistent work from quite a few outlets, and I like to give my time, my love, and even gifts. There’s a beautiful joy in doing that. In fact I love giving people presents more than I get them.  So I must be a good person, right? …Right?  But what would I be if circumstances were different? What would I be if, say, I had a sick family that counted on me to get medicine, pay for food, make sure the amenities were paid for and running such as heat, or simply paying rent to keep a roof over our heads? Would I be as honest? Would I be as loyal? I like to think so, but given my time playing Papers, Please, I’m starting to wonder about myself.  This PC game is a self-described “Dystopian Document Thriller”. I prefer the term “Dystopian Emotional Rollercoaster That Rips Out Your Morals, Waves Them In Front of You and Laughs While You Pretend You’re Not What This Game Lets You Be”. But I can see why they went with that one. It’s a bit easier to roll off the tongue.  You start the game as a rookie Immigration Inspector working at the newly acquired border town of Grestin after a six-year war with the neighbouring country of Kolechia has finally ended. The game begins on a positive note – you’re given a job, an apartment, and a seemingly easy enough task. You check over immigrant documents – much like a border guard does – and make sure the person coming through is clean.  How is this done? Cross-referencing ID cards with passport numbers. Matching pictures, making sure no document has expired, questioning minor discrepancies, checking their permits, etc. Normal things most of us have experienced one time or another just on the other side of the screen.  When I played for the first 10 minutes nothing seemed odd to me. It was just a different kind of puzzle game with a unique outlook. Rather than find the right pieces to mash together, I looked over documents and cross-referenced them with my Immigration’s rulebook, just to be safe. All in all, a pretty uneventful first day. I turned away some people and let others through.  Day two was when I realized this game was, as Michael Caine would say about Batman, something more.  I started my morning off as usual: I walked over to my booth, checked over notes my government had left for me, and proceeded to call in the first person wishing to enter the country. This was when I noticed the atmosphere this game is just oozing out its pores. The colour pallet is somber: blacks, browns and dark blues cover just about everything. On the top half of the screen is a bird’s eye view of the border. There’s my booth, a few guards, and a massive line-up of immigrants waiting to cross. Here’s what caught my eye – each person has no identity in that line. They are just a black silhouette. Another cow in the herd. I can’t connect with a person who has no face, so I don’t. Given the depth of this game and the sheer brilliance in its questioning of humanity, I know this was an intentional design choice. Emotion can only tangle logic and affect your decision. Or perhaps it’s not my view of them, but the government’s? I’m still not sure.  When I called in my first person to inspect, a black silhouette slowly dragged themselves over inside my booth. In steps a small man, standing just about 5 ft. tall and he hands me nothing. He tells me about how proud he is of Arstotzka and he excitedly recounts his itinerary. I ask him for his passport and immediately the excited tone goes away. “I need one?” “Yes.”  He promises to return with a passport and apologizes for wasting my time.  I found it a bit odd, but oh well, I moved on and called for the next person. In comes this tall, skinny woman and she hands over her passport, work permit and even slips me a card for a nightclub she says she works for. She tells me to call and let her know if I’ll be stopping into town and her girls will take care of me. I left the card on the counter and started reading her documents. Her passport number seemed OK, the names on the permit and the passport matched, she said would be staying to work for two months. Everything seemed hunky dory. I stamped an approval on her papers and gave them back to her and told her not to cause any trouble.  She smiled and walked past me.  As I call in the next person to inspect I notice this woman’s black silhouette isn’t moving in the same direction the others did. Instead of taking a right and heading off screen, she turns left and walks towards the border guards. Suddenly, the game stops. This woman takes out a grenade and tosses it near her and the guards. Before anyone can do anything it explodes, killing her and the three men on patrol. The game fades to black.  Oh god, what did I do? I’m responsible for that? Was it game over?  No. Up pops a newspaper headline about a bombing from the Kolechian terrorist that I let through. The deaths. The terror. It’s all there. Then the game fades back in and guess what? It’s day three on the job. I failed, but the game isn’t over. That’s just part of it.  It turns out I made a mistake and had my paycheck docked some. So I couldn’t pay for medicine for my sick son and food for my family.  This is when I started to pay attention to the game a bit more. Each person in the line-up wouldn’t have a face until they were in the booth with me. When they were, I was so crazy about not having another terrorist come through I would detain anyone – anyone – who looked at me wrong. Work permit says you’re here for three months but you said 7 weeks? Search and detain. That way I’m cracking down on enough people to lower the odds of a psychopath getting through and getting a few extra dollars. I was fine with this procedure and thought I would be good doing this for the rest of the game.  (Gah! There's a word limit I hit.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' is a fun puzzle game set around the unlikely theme of a Communist border control post. As the border guard for Arstotzka you are under pressure from the authorities to accurately process entrants according to ever-changing criteria, whilst juggling your meagre salary to keep yourself and your family alive. As your pay is linked to processed entrants, you have to push through as many as possible without making mistakes; mistakes are deducted from your pay. A stream of entrants queues outside your booth, meaning you only have a few seconds to make a decision - yes or no - on each. Will you help through the refugee without papers? Will you take a bribe? Will you help a dissident?  I love the grey, bleak 1984-esque world of Arstotzka and how, as a minor official, you find out about changes through the state newspaper and visitors to your booth. This is a challenging, fun puzzler, with surprisingly deep story writing and I'm really hoping there we'll get a chance to return to Arstotzka in future games from the same developer!

Your mission is to check peoples passports as they come through. It starts off very simple, Arstotzkans only. As you progress through the days it gets harder, and you will most likely get less people through, meaning less money. At the end of every day you get to manage your household, with upgrades for your booth, new apartments and food/heating cuts. The game is simple but enjoyable with amazing sounds. The game also has many achievements (some are hidden) and quests that you can choose to accept or deny. The game has 20 endings and is a nice challenge trying to get them all.

239030,"Papers, Please","You know, this is a f#cking weird game and I f#cking love it. I was not expecting myself to like it, but as usual, it has things that thick me off. As usual, I will start with those, so you know what to expect:  Now, being honest, I only found two things that caused trouble. The first of them is the limited space. 99% of the gameplay is spent comparing papers and looking if they’re legit, and to do so you have a desktop. The problem is that the desktop is small as hell. The thing is, I’m pretty sure this was made on purpose, but it doesn’t stop from being annoying. It also doesn’t help that when in fullscreen, the game has quite big black areas surrounding the game area, which do nothing and serve no purpose. The game could at least expand the window, instead of surrounding it with blackness and nothing... But then again, it's a game that you might as well play on Window mode.  The second thing that I didn’t like and caused trouble has to be with the graphics. The game is done in a pixelated style that suits it quite well, however when you have to compare photos to the people who hold them, those pixelated graphics backfire at times. A lot of times I got citations because “ID/Passport photo wasn’t the same” and crap like that when it was quite difficult to spot any difference! I ended up constantly checking them with the investigate option, and multiple times the game found differences I could just NOT spot by myself. It also doesn't help that the game bugs out at times and tells you that something matches or doesn't match when that's complete horse-sh#t and it looks like it would/wouldn't. Like the ID saying he's 1,55m tall and he seems to be nearly 2m tall, however the game will tell you that there's nothing wrong with those papers. It's hard to trust the game when crap like that keeps happening.  Lastly a third little problem, it’s not a game-breaking bug or anything, but rather an observation: You get paid by who many legit people get through. However, there are days when, I sh#t you not, only one or even no one was qualified to go through, meaning I didn’t get paid ANYTHING. That happened in two days already, and every time it happened I just restarted the day as with no pay, I would be pretty much screwed and forced to get a Game Over.  But besides that, what do you have left? A quite interesting interactive documentary about how sh#t the mid areas of Europe felt during the wars. And even though the countries in the game are fictional, they’re all based on actual countries.  The biggest point the game has running for it has to be the moral choices. It’s up to you who goes through and who doesn’t, and letting the right or wrong people in has consequences.  The audio is also good, fits quite well with the graphics. The main theme is catchy, and the rest of the game usually has ambient sounds with the made-up languages of the characters. Nothing stands out, which is good as it makes everything feel more or less natural.  The graphics, as I’ve said, have a few problems when it comes to the faces, but that being said they fit the game perfectly. Specially the still-images for what happens in special events.  The characters are also surprisingly well written, and could easily pass for real people. From corrupted douchelords to people who only want to survive, from soldiers who are forced to go through this sh#t everyday to jackasses like Jorji who are just lovable in every damn way.  Do I recommend this game? Yeah. It will put your brain to work, looking for what’s actually wrong with all those damn papers, while having a laugh or two with the current, rather sad events. The game also has, for what I know, around 20 or so endings, so that’s a good enough reason to play the game a few times. On a sale, this game is quite worth it for people who look for more casual and relaxing experiences.  TL;DR Edition: Relaxing game about people constantly trying to pass through a frontier with illegal drugs up their #sses. Well written and fun to play, it’s a good pick for any casual player who just wants to have a good time.  GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA",1,0

I was immoral, denying innocent men and women who simply wanted to leave their past demons behind. I accepted many forms of payment. I participated in a shadowy organization whose goal was to overthrow my own government.  I could not even protect the poor guard who grew up in my hometown. What else was I to tell his poor lover, who showed up days later? I watched as shouting guards and smoking guns cut down the unlucky ones. I endured the hard labor camps. I was sentenced to death for treason of the the highest order. I escaped to Obristan with my family with the help of a reformed drug smuggler. I am a traitor. I am a coward. I am a refugee. But I am a hero to my son. He still brings joy to my heart as he draws pictures with his crayons, pictures that I used to take to work.

CONS: -The font is a little hard to read at times. -The large graphic at the top of the screen showing the line of people is rather unneccessary and takes up critical screen space.

239030,"Papers, Please","With the game on sale, I think now would be a good time to try and cheer on the community to purchase it.  Made by a single man, Lucas Pope, Papers Please places you in the role of a Border Checkpoint Inspector, your job is simple, allow any cleared entrants entry to Arstotzka - the country you hail from - and deny or detain any entrants with inconsistant information, illegal items, forged documents, the list goes on, there are alot of bad and/or poor people trying to get into Arstotzka and it's your objective to stop them.  You enter your booth, you read your bulliten informing you of these new Entry Permits to help control traffic into Arstotzka, you acknowledge them and open your shutters, you click the speaker, 'NEXT!', A forienger enters your booth, 'Papers Please.', He hands you his passport and this new permit, Very well, he hails from Impor, Enkyo, thats all good- Wait, his entry permit is out of date, you inform the man of this discrepency, he replies with 'I could not come until now.', You deny him and he makes his leave, 'NEXT!'.  Now, you could of chosen to let the poor man through, however you would recieve what is called a citation, meaning that you have allowed someone access to Arstotzka whose papers were false in one way or another, your first two citations will be mere warnings, make more mistakes and it will begin to impact your payment ultimately at the cost of your family, at the end of each day you are given a report of your progress as well as the current status of your family, you are struggling to provide for four family members and on your first playthrough, you'll likely be consistantly having trouble with rent, food and current family health at constant risk of dying.  Making this even more troubling is that you are on a timer each day, so you can't really take your time with people, but at the same moment you're trying to make sure they're all clear for entry, with an incresing difficulty curve, to avoid getting even a single citation is a challenge that only the very best inspectors will beat.  What carries this game from being more than just Border Checkpoint Simulator is a deep story about a six-year war with Arstotzka's neighbouring country, Kolechia and the consequences of opening a new Border, alongside corruption, morale dilemmas and terrorism.  The game really grips you into the role as well, even the sound effects of stamping deny or approved onto a passport or moving the ID Supplement over the Entry Permit sounds crisp and believable, clear attention to detail has been made on every aspect which helps this game draw you in over the course of your daily duties.  Lucas Pope should be proud of himself, he did the unthinkable, a border checkpoint game, being fun and engaging, I respect the man for his accomplishment and I highly urge anybody on the fence about this game to pick it up, the £7 price tag is well worth it, but £1.74 is a steal you should take while you still can.

The storyline and characters are great, especially the silly guy who keeps trying to get through the check point, in one case with a passport made with crayons. I believe his name is Jorgi or something. I freaking love that dude.  This is a thoroughly wonderful game that is often stressful but with plenty of humor to keep you going. I really freaking love this game. I'd say it's the most entertaining and unique game I've come across in a long time and I'll be replaying it several times in the future just to see all the endings and really explore the full storyline. One final note is that this game can be quite difficult at times playing on normal mode. For me, usually the only thing that gets my family by day by day is taking bribes from people at the cost of a demerit. You want to do your best in this game and save those two warning demerits per day for bribes and other activities that require you to do illegal things. I haven't played on easy mode yet but I might just to see how it is to have disposable cash and afford stuff I haven't been able to afford like adopting my niece. You get 20 free credits a day supplement in easy mode.

Essentially, the gameplay boils down to being a TSA agent, but the setting, atmosphere, and music somehow manage to turn that into something so much more. You find yourself doing to people what you would hate having done to you if you were attempting to get through security at an airport or border all because of orders handed down to you and the family you are trying to protect. Do you deny someone you know is going to do something terrible despite him having all the correct documents? Do you turn away someone desperate to escape a terrible situation because his passport expired a day ago? Do you invade a person's privacy to determine their sex? It's a strange position to find yourself in and all of these scenarios add an interesting level of morality to your decisions. You keep wanting to play to see what happens next, what rules change, and what people show up at your gates. The endless mode and the multiple possible endings in the story mode add to the replayability of the title, and trust me, you will want to know what else can possibly happen based on the choices you made throughout the game.

In general, one of these 3 factors will have to suffer in order to keep the others afloat; it is possible to reach the end without any problems if you are quick and accurate, but chances are you won't be able to do this on your first playthrough, which brings me to my next point: this game has 20 (twenty!) endings, but be warned that a lot of them are fairly similar.

239030,"Papers, Please","Going into Papers Please I didn't expect much, and what I got was a very well thought out game. Which, in my opinion, is one of the best games I have ever played.   The game is set in a fictional country called Arstotska, and you have the job of being border control. You let immigrants into the country and if they don't have valid paperwork you send them on their way (later in the game you get the option to detain them). This is what I saw in the trailer, so I figured this was one of the boring of the dozens of simulators that are out on the market. So I started the game up, and realized that it was 3 in the morning.   I wouldn't say that this is a fun game, but rather I very entertaining and tense game that gets you very well intrigued with the other countless stories of other immigrants that come into your country. The stress that comes with making enough money each day to keep your family healthy is something that not even Dark Souls could replicate with it's teeth grinding difficulty. Your job becomes more and more difficult as the rules constantly change and you have to check more paperwork until your desk is flooded with it. The last couple of hours were the tense I've had in gaming for a long time. For the cons of this game, well, I can't really think of any. The only thing that comes to mind is the paperwork does become a bit less interesting by the end of the game, and becomes more of a task.   Overall I very much recommend this game, and if you haven't already, buy this game. You will be amazed at how good a paperwork simulator actually is.",1,0

You can compare it with the Portal series, you wont play for hundreds of hours, it is a game you visit ever now and then, if you feel like having some mental challenge (and no, i dont mean meantally challenged)  *Pros:* - The game design and music give it a great atmosphere - Great story and very hard desicions, which makes it very enjoyable in my opinion - relatively cheap - 20 different endings  *Cons:* - Some things are predetermined, such as the names of all the EZIC members, it would be cool if they were random - You can't play it for too long, otherwise you'll loose your concentration, and you are going to make a lot of mistakes, which can be very frustating",1,0

When I first saw Papers, Please in a gameplay commentary, I was immediately convinced I had to buy the game. I played the absolute bejesus out of this game as soon as I tried it out and completed 100% of the game in just a little bit over 20 hours. No regrets!  In Papers, Please, you play as an inspector at a border checkpoint in a fictional country called Arstotzka. Each day you are required to check the documents of applicants who wish to enter Arstotzka, which means paying attention to every little detail of information you are given by the applicants (what documents they're supposed to bring, the expiration date of said documents, stamps, etc). At the end of each day, the game shows how much you've made and whether you'd like to spend your earnings on food, heat, and/or other expenses for your family whom you've got to look after throughout the game.   If you're one who's attentive to little details, I highly recommend you to try this game. While the entire game may sound repetitive, you will be introduced to new NPCs and scenarios that will affect the way you play the game. It's a relatively small game so it can be played on pretty much any computer. Graphics-wise, I know it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally love it as it fits in really well with the whole theme of the game.   10/10 would befriend Jorji all over again.

239030,"Papers, Please","I know this game is well over a year old but I felt that it was good enough after me finally completing it to come back and do a review. 'Papers Please' is a deeply immersive 2D simulation. It gives you the relatively boring and repeditive job of being an immegration control officer and makes it fun with it's rich narrative and complementary art style. The mechanics of the game also change based on the narrative and really make the communist and authoritarian world your playing in feel all that more real as the ruels to immegration change based on the will of your nation. The many multiple endings and the achievements for the game also add to the experience and don't just feel like last minute 'tack on's' to make the game look or feel like what many would conisder 'a real game should look like'. No instead each achievement and each ending earned is something unique and either gives you context to the world in which you find yourself or it makes you question things such as the value of freedom in our own world. While I was a tad dissapointed with the meer 4 - 5 hours of game time in the main story mode of the game, none of that 4 - 5 hours was in any was dissapointing.

Can do a 2nd game of this for I can see much better improvement if they are to look into it and make it possible more challanaging to play (with the option on the game for us.) Maybe have the year of the game be in the 2000 year and have more different ppl trying to get though or possibly have a co-op mode one plays as inspector and the other plays as the security guard of the checkpoint?  either way if they were to make a second one I'd be more than willing to invest in the game if that what it takes for them to make a new one. If you have any doubts then just simply look it up on youtube, it is worth a try and is fairly cheap.

It's suprising just how involving and addictive it can be just playing as a border security guard, some random Jobsworth type, a small cog in a much larger machine. You spend all your time dealing with the most horrifyingly ugly people in a fanstasy version of what i think is meant to be Europe and determine whether their entry documents are valid. Along the way you'll have to manage your expenses for your own family to make sure their warm, fed and healthy(or at the very least one of the three) and there's rarely any money to spare as you just barely scrape through each day, going from paycheck to paycheck. You'll find yourself becoming pretty absorbed in the experience after a while and after seeing so many people who all seem the same, it becomes harder and harder to give a ♥♥♥♥ about other people's stupid little problems while trying to look out for you and yours. Papers Please stands tall above its competitors on the indie market, going for half the usual asking price and lasting twice as long and every ending feels natural and involving.

The solution to these puzzles involve meticulous readings of passports, government documents, and other miscellaneous pieces of identification. What is interesting is that these puzzles may look boring on 'paper' but in execution, they elevate the game to artistic heights that few indie games can reach.

Playing as an immigration officer for the fictional country of Arstotzka, the fate of countless strangers depends on both your skill and judgment. There will be instances where you must choose whether or not to be charitable to the needy or loyal to your family &amp; country. How the player chooses to make these decisions is done entirely through the game's mechanics and not through a quick time event or cutscene.

I was sentenced to death for treason of the the highest order. I escaped to Obristan with my family with the help of a reformed drug smuggler. I am a traitor. I am a coward. I am a refugee. But I am a hero to my son. He still brings joy to my heart as he draws pictures with his crayons, pictures that I used to take to work. Even as my beard grows grey, I hug my wife and son in the snowy fields and think to myself: Arstotzka can have its glory. I only want my family.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A simulation of what it is like to be a border guard. What seems to be a trivial matching game on the surface is actually a much deeper simulation with surprising complexity.  PROS: -A simple 'gimmick' mechanic that is expanded upon in a surprising way leading to surprising depth of play.  -Amusing secondary decisions and backstory (managing finances, choosing who to let in at cost to yourself, and other political impacts in the fictional world).  CONS: -The font is a little hard to read at times. -The large graphic at the top of the screen showing the line of people is rather unneccessary and takes up critical screen space. It would have been better if this graphic was shown whenever something happened rather than just being there all the time.",1,0

It seems as each day goes on you want to be faster and make more money. If no money is made then you cant buy food, medicine, and heat. And, if you cant buy that then your family will be sick thus resulting in later death, thus ending the game. And each time I made a mistake I found myself trying even harder next time to spot the discrepency. I almost think it is like a spot the difference game but more fast paced. So I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to spend countless hours owning a passport station.",1,0

Despite its dull grey look, oddly enough it fits very well with the style/tone of the game. Gameplay, much to my surprise, is very stressful (in a good way) and keeps you thinking. My eyes are constantly darting across the screen checking for faults and such. With the addition of your familys health/welbeing on the line of your work, it adds an element of ergency to it too.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please has no right to be fun. It's a game about doing paperwork on behalf of a Communist police state. You get to do exciting things like check people's work visa, check their medical status, confirm their passport isn't a forgery, and then use an official stamp.  And yet, somehow, the game is awesome. The plot is intriguing, the individual character stories are compelling, and it has the best moral choice system ever used in a game. Do you do what is best for you, or your nation? Do you place yourself at risk to help those in need? How do you handle corrupt superiors? How do you react to terrorist threats?  All these questions and more are yours to answer. Other games might have you saving the world from Dr SpaceBad, or making such gripping moral dilemmas as 'will you buy candy floss for the orphans or douse them in petrol and burn them alive?', but Papers Please makes a mockery of all that nonsense by putting you face to face with ordinary people. Your actions decide whether a missing travel visa means Boris Borishnakov gets to visit his daughter on her birthday. Your actions could unite an illegal immigrant with her long-lost love. You can accept a bribe and let a drug smuggler pass, or turn a blind eye to someone whose interests align with yours.  Papers Please is thrilling in ways I never imagined it could be.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Arstotzka so great, passport not required. Right?'  Wrong! Well, most of the time. It depends. Those are the rules, but sometimes the rules need to be broken. Maybe for moral reasons. Maybe because you just slipped me a bribe to stamp 'APPROVED' on your passport.  'Papers, Please' is an amazing game. It is charming, thought-provoking, and tests your powers of observation to the limit. You will fall in love with some characters, hate others, and maybe even hate yourself a little when it comes to moral dilemmas.  When a woman without proper documentation begs you to let her in so she can see her son, do you deny her? When you think of your own young son at home, do you feel for this woman and let her in? But that could mean a dock in pay, and the risk that you may not be able to feed your own family. What about the guy who is smuggling harmless medicine across the border? And what do you do when a friend of your boss tries to illegally enter, and threatens your job if you don't let her in? Do you put your foot down because rules are rules, or do you back down so your boss doesn't fire you?  Gameplay-wise, you are literally checking paperwork to ensure that people's passports and other documentation are all in order. It starts off simple and increases in complexity. Oh, and the rules change pretty much every day. Work quickly, get people through your line fast so you have enough money to pay your rent, feed your family and keep the heat running through the harsh winter. Oh, but don't go so fast that you get sloppy, because mistakes cost you -- literally. Less wages for you, you inaccurate speedster.  I know, it sounds weird and kind of boring and a bit like work, but it's incredibly engaging. If you're a good worker in the storyline, you can unlock the endless modes. There are three endless game modes: Timed (process as many people in a set amount of time), Perfection (game over at your first error), and Endurance (keep playing until your points balance goes negative). I really like the Perfection game mode. That's saying something when you can take away the story elements and the gameplay still stands as entertaining by itself.  'Papers, Please' is not really a puzzle game. It is not really a simulator. It's not really an RPG. It's something else entirely, and it's awesome.",1,0

I personally love all the ethical decision making vs. bureaucratic procedure...and the overwhelming priority to provide for your family (I could go on and on about the significance of the subject matter).

As you progress there are more things you have to look out for, and eventually you will have the choice to arrest and even defend your checkpoint with a sniper rifle and a tranq gun. Game Informer put it well. There is just something oddly satisfying about locking up a terrorist or finding something wrong with someones passport. The game also gives a good look into what sattelite states were like in the 1980's. Overall I think Papers is a good game, albeit short. While the game is short (the entire game takes place within just thirty one days), there are twenty possible endings so the replay value certainly is there.

Even though I havn't completed the game, I like the story so far and I see there's an endless mode that gets unlocked when you've completed story mode, which is good for a story type game. The only thing I don't like about this game is that is can get very boring if you play it for a while, just stamping, checking the rules, repeated. One thing I'd suggest is something so you don't have to bring out the rule book to scan the rules. But overall, nice way to kill some time.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","It is a great game, well worth the price and I do hope that the success of this one will prove to the developer that they/he or she. Can do a 2nd game of this for I can see much better improvement if they are to look into it and make it possible more challanaging to play (with the option on the game for us.) Maybe have the year of the game be in the 2000 year and have more different ppl trying to get though or possibly have a co-op mode one plays as inspector and the other plays as the security guard of the checkpoint?  either way if they were to make a second one I'd be more than willing to invest in the game if that what it takes for them to make a new one. If you have any doubts then just simply look it up on youtube, it is worth a try and is fairly cheap.   The bad thing I can think of this game is that the gameplay screen is a little too small for my liking BUT it hasn't ruined my experience of the game, it is a defo game to add to your library. My final rating of this game is a 8/10 Only thing from stopping it from getting a 10 out 10 is the gameplay screen and after awhile playing it, it can be predicable so I'd love to see some dlc's added to this game or them making a second game of 'Papers, Please.'",1,0

All the while trying to stay a good person. The only problem I have with the game is that you can much too easily cheat by going through another day that went bad, this time knowing what will happen, which can take some of the chalange away.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please asks you a few interesting questions: after being assigned to man the border checkpoint what'll you do? Follow your corrupt and oppressive government laws by the letter or try and sneak a few poor souls in? Will you accept bribes? Will you try and help the rebels or just see how things pan out? How far will you go to make ends meet and ensure the safety of yourself and those you love?   PROS:   -despite sporting a minimalist art style the game graphics are convincingly bleak and oppressive   -simple yet catchy and appropriate music  -the game throws you several moral dilemmas, some decisions will give positive results, others won't change much while a few might be the end of you  -an engaging and branching storyline with a 20 different endings  -save system saves each day separately, you can also go back to a certain day and make different decisions thus generating a new save branch: this lets you experiment freely with the various outcomes  -smooth difficulty curve, new documents and rules are slowly introduced  -you'll get to meet interesting characters  -some examples of dry humor help balance the overall grim story  -having to correctly process enough entrants to ensure you have money to pay for rent, food, heating and surprise expenses really makes for a tense experience   CONS:   -since you're stamping documents and looking for discrepancies the gameplay is, by itself, pretty repetitive in nature  -some levels really throw alot of different documents and permits your way, making screening for discrepancies quite stressful (ofc this is a design choice)  -the simple graphics sometimes make spotting differences in facial features harder than it'd be   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457423093   Papers, Please ends up being a quite engaging experience: you'd easily be fooled by its straightforward gameplay but the truth is there's way more to it. Its depth comes from how you can shape the story, the moral choices you'll make and their results on you and the characters you'll be meeting. All things considered the best question the game asks is 'What kind of person are you?'. Your decisions and their outcomes will be the answer.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a terrific puzzler developed by Lucas Pope. You work as an inspector for an Arstotzkan border and have to check all of their papers to be sure they are valid for entry.  The graphics of the game are extremely simplistic, lovable and eye catching. After every day, you get to see how your family is doing and have to buy food and/or heat for them. There are many interactions you can have with your family, such as your son having a birthday and you buying a gift for them. Leaving them without food or heat for too long will eventually kill them, but hey, less mouths to feed and warm.  Sometimes, there are terrorist attacks and you must stop them with your tranquilizer. You get a bonus for this. Also, while we're on the topic of terrorists, an infamous group called EZIC will contact you during the game. You will get bonuses from them, and a few of the endings revolve around EZIC. You do not have to do all of what EZIC tells you to do, but it's more enjoyable (in my opinion) following them.  You can upgrade your booth for easier inspecting. Some of the upgrades include pressing tab to open your stamps, space to check their papers for discrepencies, etc.  While there is fun moments, the discrepency detector can be a bit buggy, which could kill the fun. I think overall, Papers, Please is a terrific game and if you have the money lying around do get it.   9.5/10   (Jorji lives!)",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","A 2013 release that really stands out for its gameplay, Papers, Please is not for everyone. If you're looking for the perfect break from all the grindy MMOs and shoot-em-ups, this may be just the title you're looking for.  In Papers, Please, you play out the role of a border inspector working in a dystopian country. Each potential immigrant presents you with a set of papers that may or may not fit the rule of the law, and it's up to you to find discrepancies in the paperwork - and to occasionally let humanity win out and break the law to help others. It's a truly memorable game that you shouldn't miss if you have any interest in releases that help define gaming as an art form.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is the best desk space management simulator I have ever played.  To be truthful, I never would have bought this if I hadn't tried it for free, first. Trying to figure out why people loved the game so much, all I came away with was that you worked at a thing and you looked at papers and you had to make tough decisions that could affect you, your family, or the people you meet. Which, you know, doesn't sound bad or anything, it just doesn't hype me up to the level of the people who understood it better.  So if you get the chance to play it, do it. That's what I'm telling you before we get into this. If you know somebody who has it, ask them to let you play to, say, Day 5 or something on their computer. It will be on your Steam wishlist that evening, sure enough.  In Papers, Please you are the head of an eastern European-esque household, and you have been selected by the Labor Lottery to do your part as an immigration inspector at a border checkpoint. Got all that? Your job is to sit in your booth on the Arstotzka/Grestin border and check everybody's paperwork for incorrect info and falsified documentation. You will be checking for anything and everything across the board. From incorrect genders to slight differences in weight, to wrong photos, to mismatched birthdates, to missing copies of newly required identification, to forged stamps, to possible aliases. On top of it all, the rules are constantly changing. You may be asked not to admit anybody from a certain country. And then the next day you're asked not to, anymore. It keeps you on your toes, and keeps you paying attention so you don't become complacent and bored.  It seems daunting, at first. It truly does. But as you go, you get the hang of things. Your first playthrough might not be great, but that second one will undoubtedly be much, much better.  Now, this is not all that you'll have to worry about. Your family needs food, heat, and of course a place to live (among other things). These things cost money. You receive $5 for every properly processed traveller, $0 for your first two mistakes of the day, and an increasing penalty for each mistake after that. In a typical day, I can usually manage about 10-12 correct assessments, although not all days are exactly typical, and you may find yourself going home early on occasion for this reason or that.  Then comes the real decisions. You hold the cards, here. You could let somebody pass with incorrect credentials, but you will receive a citation. Rack up enough citations, and you can expect a chewing out down the line. Plus the aforementioned lack of pay/penalty. On the other hand, some people give you good reasons to let them through. A story of love or revenge. Bribery. Or perhaps you just like the person and figure you don't need $5  that  badly at the moment. You will need to weigh the pros and cons, and maybe take a few chances as you just try to do your job and keep your head down... or maybe a little more.  There are 20 endings in all, but that's a little misleading. Several groups of those are just variations on a single ending. Only a handful of endings will grant achievements. And only one will unlock Endless Mode.  It really probably doesn't sound amazing just having it described to you. But trust me when I say that the fun gameplay and unique personality and atmosphere of Papers, Please will thoroughly draw you in if you just play it a little bit for yourself. For that, it's worth the buy.  Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of those rare games that looks horribly boring on paper (hah!), but has an uncanny ability to pull you in if you give it some time. As an inspector working at the border of the made-up communist country of Arstotzka in 1982, your days are spent looking at passports and legal documents for entry (God knows why so many people WANT to go there, but I'll easily forgive that plothole).  The gameplay is basically cross-examining the information on said papers with the current rules for immigration. As the days pass by, the rules change. New papers may be needed, you have to scan people for contraband or validate their gender, and every now and then you get some people who try to appeal to your human side and beg you to look the other way.  It's an idea that should not work. But it does. Papers, Please is a delightful little indiegame that really proves how innovative and entertaining games can be - even when there is only one person on the development-staff - if that one person knows how to play to his strenghts. The low-fi graphics are absolutely essensial for setting the mood of a country behind the iron-curtain in '82 and the artstyle is perfect.  Easily worth the price of admission.

It's not some gimpy social commentary, it's a well-rounded game with a thoughtful premise and despite the outdated graphics you get something that isn't commonly seen in games today: style. Everything is sylized and despite the obvious indication that you're playing a game, you WILL be immersed after playing a few 'levels'. Like a good book, you will not be able to put this game down. Most games will get you emotionally invested in a character after several pages of dialogue if not more, but 'Papers, Please' masterfully draws you into each and every character with only several LINES. The weightiness of each situation is real, the consequence is real, and if you thought you knew who you were before this game I assure you that you will see yourself for who you really are after your first playthrough. Your choices actually have consequence, and the choices themselves are carefully constructed to test you. It's not just black and white, as you define who you are as an inspector you in turn shape your nation. It's literally nationstates: the game. I love it. I'm reccomending this game to everyone I know, it's just that good. As a puzzle game goes, this quirky thing is way up there with Meteos and Professor Layton. It can compete with the best of them. Don't play easy mode, play the way the developer intended. If you feel the time limit is too overwhelming for you, don't feel bad and drop this game. It's supposed to be overwhelming at first, but as time goes on you'll start to assess situations more effeciently (Like a real job! Go figure.) and it will simulate the feeling of 'becoming a cog' in a system that is seemingly out of your control.   PICK. THIS. THE F**K. UP.",1,0

There's something both addicting and terribly sad about this title. The lines begin to blur as you realize that the rules you're following are causing genuine hardship on others.

In Papers, Please, you play out the role of a border inspector working in a dystopian country. Each potential immigrant presents you with a set of papers that may or may not fit the rule of the law, and it's up to you to find discrepancies in the paperwork - and to occasionally let humanity win out and break the law to help others.

239030,"Papers, Please","I was introduced to this game through the most unlikely source I was asking people what's a great game to get during a Sale for Steam. I follow actor and indie game creator Wiley Wiggins he's known for his fantastic roll in Dazed and Confused. Well I asked him what was one game I should get on here for the sale and he told me 'You should get a indie game called Papers, Please' he gave me so many details about it I started to get intrested and man I made the correct choice. Not only is this game Terrific but it's also a very well thought out History lesson you'll but it and Study it, it has so much to offer yet the backround is sadly the truth I had to stop a few times to question and to think never has a game done that for me. I highly reccommend this game not only is it a game game to play but again it makes you really think. I saw puzzel and I really didn't think I would like it but I'm glad I got the great review from an expert like Wiggins. Glad I added it to my Library. So many themes and it's sad to know this still goes on",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is a great one to play if you're looking to kill a lot of time. It seems to suck you into it's world where you work as a border control personel. Not only does it focus on a keen eye for detail but it also has many personal decisions that must be made in relation to your family's health and wellbeing. An interesting feature is the multiple endings, meaning every decision you made may be crucial to how the game plays out. I dislike that you can't tell what endings you have already achieved and have to restart from the beginning to work on a different path (it's easier than trying to find out where crucial moments happened because nothing on the 'episode' screens tell you exactly what major or minor events occured. I would definitely recommend this game still since it is extremely addicting. A great way to kill some time.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Simple interface, simple graphics, simple enough way to explain how this game works. But it draws you in quick. It's a paperwork simulator, sure, but it's engaging and interesting. You are in charge of a border checkpoint and have to make sure only those meeting certain criteria are allowed in. If that were it, it would be fairly boring. But underneath it all, there's little things that affect how you play. Do you take a kickback to help pay for rent? How about saving up for your son's birthday? Do you let the person with expired documentation in, or send her back to her country where she will be killed?  It draws you in with the little stories. I don't think any other game has presented moral choices in a light such as this. Yes, you can do good and try to help people, but in doing so, you may be fined, and your family might starve. Do you show compassion and watch your family suffer, or do you protect your family, at the expense of being seen as the cold uncaring bureaucrat?",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I took a leap of faith when I decided to purchase Papers, Please. It's a game I heard great things from but never really appealed to me when I saw some footage of the game. When the game won the Community Voter's Choice during the Steam Holiday Sale I decided to see if my $5 would be a good investment for something new. I'm happy to report that Papers, Please not only impressed me, but turned out to be one of the most addictive and intelligent games I've ever played. Papers, Please is a game that puts you in the role of a border patrol agent. Your task is to take passports from many incoming immigrants and citizens and either allow or deny them access to the dictatorship that is Arstotzka. The people you meet all have varied personalities and some are more patient than others. The game challenges you as you constantly have to review information for any discrepancies that you may find. This may result in invalid gender, issuing city, or an false identity. Even more so is many of your clients will come to you and beg for entry or bribe you so they can access the country and not delay their plans. Your role is to ofcourse, make money. You have to survive but also take care of your family which consists of your son, mother-in-law, uncle, and wife. These people can get sick, hungry or cold. You'll have to balance your money and choose whether to feed your family, turn on the heat, or give your sick family member medicine before they die. There is also a conspiracy theory going on deep within the city. Some people you meet will be secret agents, government officials, or members from a dark old organization. This game will challenge your moral standpoint as you'll have to decide whether you can trust someone or whether the person who's supposed to be someone, really is that person. The game will take up more time than you'd expect but will constantly challenge you and pull you into it's well crafted gameplay. Papers, Please is truly a game that you'll get value out of. It will make you question your morals and make you feel the emotional weight of your every decision.",1,0

The tough thing is keeping track of the regulations in the tiny book they give you. I had to write some stuff down on paper. It would be nice if you could quickly switch to a screen with all the regulations visible at once.

239030,"Papers, Please","So I bought Papers, Please on a whim. I didn't really bother looking at the reviews or researching much into the game. It was on sale, I had some extra money to use, I thought it looked vaguely interesting and Steam recommended it to me. For the longest time, I avoided the game. The more I thought about it, the more I regretted buying it.  But then I opened it.  Then I quit for a while because it was slow and boring.  BUT THEN I CAME BACK.  It was a much different experience than what I am used to in games, sitting and analyzing as quickly as you can, so risk losing everything. I came to feel the path I was taking from cold apathy to the people behind the papers or forgiving sympathy, from the quiet, burning passion of hating the repressive government with all of my being to hating the group who dared destroy the life I was making for myself. The game makes you feel for what is going on around you while also forcing you to analyze at breakneck speed and I love it. After playing for so long, I have all of the issuing cities memorized ((except for a few hiccups)) and I find myself getting faster and faster every playthrough. I find this greatly satisfying, and I love the new procedures because they add a whole new element, even though they can be tedious sometimes, especially when you add the ocassional work pass. The game still manages to lace in well-placed humor, though, even when you're working at a job where you have to deal with miserable people in a desolate place.  Somehow, the way that your choices aren't extrememly consequential is also pleasing, because it shows that, in real life, certain things you do really won't matter in the big picture, but it mattered to someone, and that's what's important.   On to less of my feelings, the game play is smooth, although, at the beginning, it can be frustration to have to use your mouse for everything, but once you get a little further, the booth upgrades work wonders; plus, when you don't have the opportunity to upgrade, it's mostly in the part where you can cast a single glance at the documents and decide their fate. The game isn't very large, either, so it's easy to run on your computer without having to deal with much lag, unless you are severely overloading your computer.   I keep coming back to this game again and again when I want to get away from everything, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Please read my full review at my personal blog:  http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2016/06/27/Papers-Please-game-review.aspx   Exerpts from review: 'Papers, Please is a funny little game in that it is so dedicated to its theme that the game actually does start to feel almost like a real job. You have to click and drag to open up documents, sort through papers, check dates, make sure the document was issued in a valid city, and so on. It's a lot of mundane work, and if you miss any little detail, then you have an omniscient boss who will print out a citation. I quickly came to anticipate the sound of a citation being printed with a Pavlovian anxiety after sending applicants through, even for the ones whose documents I thought I had thoroughly checked. You get two warnings before your omniscient boss starts docking your pay, which keeps constant pressure on you to try to be as close to perfect as possible. Paying for this game is almost like paying for a second job that you, yourself, don't get paid for. And it's kind of a crappy job, at that.'  'But even though the job you're simulating is a crappy job, the game isn't crappy by any stretch of the imagination. The mechanics are fairly simple and straightforward. You just click and drag to shift papers around on a desk surface, and click to turn pages. If you notice something in one document that violates a rule or contradicts with another document, you press a button to highlight the two contradictory items and then click another button to question the immigrant about it. You then line the passport underneath an 'approve' or 'deny' stamp and then drag the documents back to the immigrant to either let them through or send them away. It reminds me of the interrogation segments of L.A. Noire distilled down into an entire game. Except that it manages to avoid the ridiculous tone shifts and somehow manages to create a more natural and engaging process with the possibility of genuine failure.'  'You shift from following simple procedures, to following more complicated procedures, to eventually making judgement calls and moral decisions. It's all very smoothly integrated and creates a growing escalation of tension and stakes as you have to balance your own individual budget with the demands of your government, the bribes of a mysterious insurrection organization, and the requests of the people who you are supposedly trying to serve. As you're playing this very simple, small role of checking passports at an immigration checkpoint, an elaborate story of war and political tension slowly reveals itself and escalates around you.'  My only complaint is that it could maybe use a better tutorial, as the interface does take a little bit of getting used to. Other than that, this is an outstanding game that I highly recommend.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Excellent game, and at around 4 hours for a playthrough, it only slightly overstays its welcome. The document checking aspect slowly gets more complex and then kind of flattens out for the final 10-15% of the game, which makes things maybe a bit anticlimactic. Story wise, it's nice and branches into 2 main arcs, but the gameplay is a bit too tedious for a second playthrough imho.  I highly recommend printing a 'cheat sheet' with the different countries' seals and cities; if I was a border guard I would probably tape up a cheat sheet to the window, so why not do it in game? Alleviates a lot of the frustration with having to fiddle through the in-game book a few hundred extra times.  While it's been overhyped ad nauseum, I do think it's worth a play regardless. It's a unique game which doesn't necessarily make it great, but a 4 hour unique experience is worth it if you can find time between other games or need a break from 'normal' games.",1,0

There are also different orginisations that will try to get involved with you. These orginisations are very risky as one is Anti-Government. If you are caught being associarted with them you will get sent to prison and your game will be over, but if you don't get caught you will gain a lot of money.

239030,"Papers, Please","A sweet little game with a dark atmosphere and a sad truth lurking in the background. Simplistic and repetetive, but still I liked it. The game is simple. You're a bordercontrol officer (chosen from a work-lottery, no less) and you have to control that the people crossing the border has valid papers, the right papers, that they're not on the run from the law etc etc, and at the same time pay your bills and keep your family warm, fed and attended if sick. To do so you need money, and the more people you pass through the border successfully, the more money you make.  8/10. (I lost my dear in-game son to illness btw so nobody's perfect)",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I have just discovered that game and I'm not quite sure what makes it great. Is it the fact that you deny entrance to your country to poor people who have nowhere else to go? Is it the fact you strive to earn enough money to feed your family and always seem to fail? Perhaps. Or not. If I had been told that checking passports, I.D cards and work permits was so much fun, I would have studied to become a border guard.  The game depicts in an extreme but humorous way, a communist country which has recently re-opened its borders. You have just won the work lottery. Congratulations, you are one of the only ones to have an actual job now. You still won't be able to pay the rent or feed your family, but at least, you have work!  The game in itself is very smart, the difficulty increases slowly but surely. You must verify the expiry dates, check all documents, the gender, weight, height, passport number, diplomatic seals, issuing cities, etc. Once in a while, events occur and the policies change. You dismantle bombs, get extra earnings by shooting at people or detaining them. Sometimes, you even get 'special' visits. With about 20 different endings, this game is as deep as it can be while remaining 100% entertaining.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I was introduced to this game through the most unlikely source I was asking people what's a great game to get during a Sale for Steam. I follow actor and indie game creator Wiley Wiggins he's known for his fantastic roll in Dazed and Confused. Well I asked him what was one game I should get on here for the sale and he told me 'You should get a indie game called Papers, Please' he gave me so many details about it I started to get intrested and man I made the correct choice. Not only is this game Terrific but it's also a very well thought out History lesson you'll but it and Study it, it has so much to offer yet the backround is sadly the truth I had to stop a few times to question and to think never has a game done that for me. I highly reccommend this game not only is it a game game to play but again it makes you really think. I saw puzzel and I really didn't think I would like it but I'm glad I got the great review from an expert like Wiggins. Glad I added it to my Library. So many themes and it's sad to know this still goes on",1,0

Not only does it focus on a keen eye for detail but it also has many personal decisions that must be made in relation to your family's health and wellbeing. An interesting feature is the multiple endings, meaning every decision you made may be crucial to how the game plays out. I dislike that you can't tell what endings you have already achieved and have to restart from the beginning to work on a different path (it's easier than trying to find out where crucial moments happened because nothing on the 'episode' screens tell you exactly what major or minor events occured.

Rarely do they have it so well integrated into the actual gameplay itself; as many have it thrown in a dialogue tree (usually after killing a small country's worth of populace).   Papers, Please   has raised the bar on how to combine story and gameplay in a simple to learn manner, while cranking up the tasks and making even the toughest border patrol agent slip-up here and there. First it is just ID card and country, then those plus work pass. After a big event, now you have to have armed guards. It's hard to talk about the mechanics without giving away the story, that is how intertwined they are. There are many endings as well but I really feel this game shows what games really do well: creating the story through gameplay. If you would have told me in my teenage years that I would fall in love with a game about playing a checkpoint agent at the border of a somewhat Eastern European country where my family depended on my job performance but so did the possible outcome of my country, I wouldn't believe you.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a very unique and entertaining game. Why is it unique? Because you play a role that is not often played in a game. A border guard in a corrupt communist country constantly dealing with forged documents and terrorist attacks. Additionally, the gameplay in general is not very common. Thoroughly inspecting papers and stamping them? Try and find another game that offers you that. Now, I know the idea of a game which has gameplay centering around basically doing paperwork doesn't sound very entertaining... but trust me on this one, it is.  Let me talk about the pros and cons of this game.  PROS: * Brilliantly written story * Interesting universe that you're always wanting to learn more about * Characters that you know little about and yet get invested in so quickly * Unique gameplay * Pixely but good graphics  CONS: * Slightly dull and boring gameplay * Fairly difficult gameplay * Jorji Costava  This game is definitely not for everyone. However, if you like things such as alternate history (especially communist timelines), games where you remain in one spot, and a game where the universe is likely the best part, Papers, Please is no-doubt for you.  Even if you feel like it's not aimed at you, give it a try. It's worth your money. I would highly recommend Papers, Please to anyone.  As for those of you who are too damn stubborn to try the game...  - The Ministry of Justice has become aware of your stubbornness and refusal to play Papers, Please. - You are under arrest for your horrible crimes. An investigation will follow your imprisonment. - Your family's safety is unknown. - Your Steam account will remain running under a replacement. - Glory to Arstotzka.  I'd give Papers, Please a 9/10.

239030,"Papers, Please",Papers Please isn't like any other game. Papers Please has a amazing story with unique gameplay centred around a job at border control. But as the game continues so does the story and you have many different interactions. Its great because a very small act can send you to the top or can send you to jail. The best thing is the moral choices such as: do you take a bribe and risk being caught? Do you buy medicine for your child or heat the house?  The game seems very basic and boring at the start but as you play on it becomes much more interesting.  Final Verdict: 9/10,1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I resisted this game for awhile because I felt like it wouldn't be fun. Like many others, I compared it to real life work. It doesn't feel like I'm at (real life) work. It takes a little while to build up momentum so don't judge the fun factor too quickly. Once it gets going, it's easy to see what all the buzz is about. Alot of indie games try to be intelligent, Papers Please is one of the few that actually is. The game scores points on: STORY (thoughtful and satirical narratives are seemlessly woven into the game) , GAMEPLAY (smooth innovative gameplay mechanics), VISUALS (though they are admittedly retro, the visuals are stylish and fit the overall tone of the game perfectly), and SOUND (not amazing, but very effective). I personally love all the ethical decision making vs. bureaucratic procedure...and the overwhelming priority to provide for your family (I could go on and on about the significance of the subject matter). In short, you have never played a game like this before. If you can approach it with an open mind, you will have a lot of fun. (plus you get to shoot stuff...if that's your thing.)",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","A cool game! Also a very weird game, most definitely not for everyone. You are a man providing for your wife, kid, mother-in-law, and uncle, and possibly more family as you go on. You work on the border of your communist country, deciding who does and does not get to enter, and are faced with some difficult decisions at times. The game gets more and more challenging, and if you mess up too much, or go in debt, you could end up in prison.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Before I played this game, if someone had told me that I would find comparing and evaluating paperwork to be at all enjoyable I would have called them a liar and a couple other names to boot. After having played Papers, Please though, I have to admit that - at least in this game - paperwork can be fun.  It doesn't seem like such a difficult concept at first: receive documentation from person, examine documentation (and sometimes the person) for any discrepancies, approve and deny as appropriate. Like many things though, what is explained simply is not so easy to do. While the game starts off with one document you need to examine, before long you're looking at as many as 5 pieces of paperwork for any one person, each which must be examined for consistency within itself AND compared to all other documentation. It could be overwhelming, but the difficulty curve of Papers, Please is ramped up perfectly, neither too fast nor too slow. By the time you're faced with this wall of documentation you're prepared... mostly.  I know, I know, what I've described sounds like a harrowing experience. Yes, it can be tense at times, but for some reason it's also rather fun. The precise reason why escapes me in part, but a good deal of the enjoyment comes simply from the challenge of trying to figure out when someone is attempting to slip something past you, potentially for nefarious reasons even. Every forged document, stolen identity, or smuggled bit of explosives you find is a satisfying emotional payoff, a virtual pat on the back for having stopped someone up to no good.  Truthfully though, what makes Papers, Please an enjoyable experience isn't so much the gameplay as the story. Not that the gameplay isn't solid, but much of the appeal would be meaningless without the personal drama that comes across on any given day of it. Love, death, loss, joy, sadness, humor, all come across in the small conversations and interactions the player character has with the various people he encounters. Mindlessly approving or denying paperwork all day is somewhat trivial, but what if your decision to approve or deny a passport could make the difference between a family being reunited and one being torn apart? Between true love and tragic loss? What if it could shape the very future of the country you serve? All of these things come up as part of the plot of Papers, Please, and there's no right or wrong answer to each. Your actions have consequences, and for better or worse you can see them out.  Bluntly put, Papers, Please is a perfect example of how decent plot and unique gameplay can combine to form something greater than the sum of each. Examined separately, the plot of Papers, Please is a bit derivative, while the gameplay is mostly unique rather than truly gripping. Combined as expertly as they are, however, leads to a final result that is both highly enjoyable and very memorable.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","There aren't many games that when I finish I immediately start over again, but PapersPlease has done it. I smiled as I reunited lovers. I cried when I had to arrest Jorji and he simply said, 'Ah, is ok.' My heartbeat trebled when I had to shoot down terrorists. I felt joy as I slowly worked on securing my families future. I felt gutted when I was told I was going to be executed tonight. ♥♥♥♥-totzka indeed.  The pacing of this game is unreal. It just never lets up. Just when you think you can catch a breather, it grabs you by the throat with something new. I genuinely want to pack in my job and stamp visas all day in hope that it's exactly the same. Although that damned printer would probably cause me to flip.  Absolutely cannot recommend it enough. Just be warned it's not a game, it's a second life.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please has no right to be fun. It's a game about doing paperwork on behalf of a Communist police state. You get to do exciting things like check people's work visa, check their medical status, confirm their passport isn't a forgery, and then use an official stamp.  And yet, somehow, the game is awesome. The plot is intriguing, the individual character stories are compelling, and it has the best moral choice system ever used in a game. Do you do what is best for you, or your nation? Do you place yourself at risk to help those in need? How do you handle corrupt superiors? How do you react to terrorist threats?  All these questions and more are yours to answer. Other games might have you saving the world from Dr SpaceBad, or making such gripping moral dilemmas as 'will you buy candy floss for the orphans or douse them in petrol and burn them alive?', but Papers Please makes a mockery of all that nonsense by putting you face to face with ordinary people. Your actions decide whether a missing travel visa means Boris Borishnakov gets to visit his daughter on her birthday. Your actions could unite an illegal immigrant with her long-lost love. You can accept a bribe and let a drug smuggler pass, or turn a blind eye to someone whose interests align with yours.  Papers Please is thrilling in ways I never imagined it could be.

At some point in this game you will have to decide whether allowing a woman to enter the country to see her dying son is worth the death of one of your family members because you can't pay the bills, and THIS is why I like this game. With so many things to keep in mind when checking whether an individual should be allowed into the country it is bound to happen that you slip and make a mistake, but it helps you develop your multi tasking and detail searching abilities. This is a great game to pass the time and once you start you wont stop.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game has NO right to be fun as it is. The game boils down to you scanning documents for inaccuracies, and approving or denying entry to various citizens of the futuristic world trying to enter your home country; Arkotsk. You were drafted into working there, and you and your family were forced to move to a new rent-controlled home. You are expected to pay for their food, heat, medicine, and other needs as well as a hefty rent on your measly salary as border/customs agent.   What's really cool about this game though, is that while at first you struggle with the simple basics of the 'job', it soon becomes second nature. Once you become a jaded ♥♥♥♥ at the customs office you start to notice weird things happening around you; corrupt guards, terrorist attacks, ethical dilemnas relating to your post, bombs, murders, and of course forged documents.  It takes only a very short time to get into, and you'll likely want to play it more than one time since you'll fail the first time and recieve the 'worst; of the 20 DIFFERENT ENDINGS. One playthrough takes about 3 hours but checkpoints are created at every day, allowing you to explore all the alternate endings easily.

You are immediately assigned to a newly acquired Grestin Border Checkpoint which is not all that secure a lot of people are trying to get in and it’s your job to make sure that the right people are getting in and the wrong people are staying behind.  Although the gameplay is simplistic you will find that the difficulty ramps up very quickly as you are given more documents to sort through. This difficulties compound by the fact you are trying to earn as much money as possible by processing as many people as you can in order to feed and support your family. While this creates a lot of tension in the game it has unfortunate side effect that also makes the interface more cluttered which can have a disadvantageous effect when you are trying to juggle all the different papers, it can become very confusing and very frustrating.  This is really a minor complaint because overall the game is absolutely excellent, the story is immersive and there is a lot of interesting characters throughout but what makes this game so special is its atmosphere, from the RT soundtrack to the excellent dialogue, you legitimately feel that you are a part of a war-torn communist steep.

It's fun as heck to hecticly sort through all of the different slips and forms.  The game's style is very gritty grey and pixilated. An unapealing style for an unapealing world. Nice touch. The combination of the dialogue and info on the passports really makes it feel like every immigrant has its own story.  The game definitely has it's emotinal moments. It had the times I went 'D'awww', and it had the times I went 'YOU FREAKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!'  Bottomline, I'd recommend it. You get into the rhythm of things once you start memorising what you need to check on the forms, and there is a ton of replay value from all of the different endings you can get.

239030,"Papers, Please","10/10  Papers, Please is a game that can never be matched, purely by the perfect way this game was executed. You are an immigration inspector at the border town of Grestin. Your goal is simple; do your job correctly, get the money, and keep you and your family alive. But no, it is not this simple. You are the person that changes peoples lives entirely. To allow an individual into the country is completely your choice; a power that should not be given to a single person.   For a game with such a simple as well as unique concept, Papers, Please showed just how in-depth something so simple can go. From any person's perspective, it's a simple process: Accept. Deny. Accept. Deny. However, Something that simple is something that you cannot afford in Papers, Please. Passports, Entry Permits, Identity Supplements; all documents that each person must present to you; the inspector. Your duty is to correctly accept and deny immigrants into the country, (who may very well be terrorists, smugglers, and murderers,) in the country of Arstotzka.  What makes Papers, Please the brilliant game that it is lies in every fiber of its design. From the art style to the dialogue., this game will present new ideals into your mind, making you wonder what the true right or wrong thing to is. Papers, Please will make you want to keep your job more than any real world job ever will, that is a given fact. Getting penalized by the Ministry of Admission for incorrectly allowing people into Arstotzka will fill every inch of your body with paranoia. Even as you skim down someone's passport you will feel a small pinch in the back of your head, worrying that you checked something wrong. Being thorough means everything in this game, in the booth or at your Class 8 Apartment.  Papers, Please is a game that you have never seen or played before. With perfect atmosphere, story, and dialogue, this game has quickly made its way to my favorite games list. For the small price of only 10 credits, this game is less expensive than your son's birthday present! Buy it already!  Glory to Arstotzka. Back to work.",1,1

The world they have created is immersive and the characters throughout have compelling reasons (both good and bad) why they should be let through the checkpoints. Small stories carry throughout the game, and may end differently depending on how you decide their fate. The decisions you make may impact how far you make it in the game, as deviating from your job description can land you in jail (and end this game short).

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is fantastic. It combines a charming artstyle, engrossing narrative and a truly unique set of core mechanics for a one-off experience.  You assume the role of a border inspector, and the gameplay revolves around allowing people to pass into a state, denying them, or detaining them. You don't want to know any more than that: the first run through is best done blind, experiencing all the plot twists/quirks as you choose and shape your own adventure. There are twenty endings. The game offers a nice difficulty curve, adding extra documents or rules with each 'day' to keep you on your toes. It is never unfair.  The atmosphere, too, is great. The music recalls every Soviet stereotype you can think of, while the art style channels the bleak misery of 20th Century Post-Soviet Europe.  As a broader comment, the game also makes you appreciate/understand to a greater extent the job done by border guards. As a frequent traveller, border guards often seem obtuse or rude: in reality, as this game goes some way to demonstrate, the concentration and vigilance needed is remarkable.  For $10/£7, you cannot go wrong with Papers, Please. If it is in a sale, you have no excuse. Highly recommended.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of those rare games that looks horribly boring on paper (hah!), but has an uncanny ability to pull you in if you give it some time. As an inspector working at the border of the made-up communist country of Arstotzka in 1982, your days are spent looking at passports and legal documents for entry (God knows why so many people WANT to go there, but I'll easily forgive that plothole).  The gameplay is basically cross-examining the information on said papers with the current rules for immigration. As the days pass by, the rules change. New papers may be needed, you have to scan people for contraband or validate their gender, and every now and then you get some people who try to appeal to your human side and beg you to look the other way.  It's an idea that should not work. But it does. Papers, Please is a delightful little indiegame that really proves how innovative and entertaining games can be - even when there is only one person on the development-staff - if that one person knows how to play to his strenghts. The low-fi graphics are absolutely essensial for setting the mood of a country behind the iron-curtain in '82 and the artstyle is perfect.  Easily worth the price of admission.

239030,"Papers, Please","If you haven't played this game, you're missing out. It's not the pretentious indie game you would come to expect. It was worth every penny and my playing time proves it. It's not some gimpy social commentary, it's a well-rounded game with a thoughtful premise and despite the outdated graphics you get something that isn't commonly seen in games today: style. Everything is sylized and despite the obvious indication that you're playing a game, you WILL be immersed after playing a few 'levels'. Like a good book, you will not be able to put this game down. Most games will get you emotionally invested in a character after several pages of dialogue if not more, but 'Papers, Please' masterfully draws you into each and every character with only several LINES. The weightiness of each situation is real, the consequence is real, and if you thought you knew who you were before this game I assure you that you will see yourself for who you really are after your first playthrough. Your choices actually have consequence, and the choices themselves are carefully constructed to test you. It's not just black and white, as you define who you are as an inspector you in turn shape your nation. It's literally nationstates: the game. I love it. I'm reccomending this game to everyone I know, it's just that good. As a puzzle game goes, this quirky thing is way up there with Meteos and Professor Layton. It can compete with the best of them. Don't play easy mode, play the way the developer intended. If you feel the time limit is too overwhelming for you, don't feel bad and drop this game. It's supposed to be overwhelming at first, but as time goes on you'll start to assess situations more effeciently (Like a real job! Go figure.) and it will simulate the feeling of 'becoming a cog' in a system that is seemingly out of your control.   PICK. THIS. THE F**K. UP.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a game that seems to undersand that the player has morality and encourages them to follow it but with the result being that their actions also affect their pay check, too many citations you lose pay or even fall into debt.

You have the option to aid a rebellion or just follow orders among other things, each stamped passport could be terrorist you missed or a agent of the rebellion you forgot about. Papers, Please has amazing replay value and with twenty endings it's not surprising that it does.   Most consiter the art style hidiouse but it futhers the athmostsphere of the game, it's supposed to show the downtrodden people who are trying to get into Arstotska, people who you might be suspisous of and be more inclinded to detain or deny them entry.

239030,"Papers, Please","Informally dubbed 'Slav Simulator 1984', this is by far one of my more favourite titles.  Like Orwellian themes? This is essentially a must buy. The dark communist eastern vibe that is painted within this game is nothing short of amazing.   What's so unique and great about this game is that it shapes it's gameplay in a unique fashion pertaining to the scenario of the game, as opposed to being a fixed genre that the game's narrative and world has to at least somewhat acommodate. Have you ever seen a border control 'simulator' before of a similar ilk? Me neither.  You are the father figure of a poor village family that lives in Artztotzka, a totalitarian country held together with pride and an iron fist. You work as a border controller officer, checking passports of all border entrants. The story itself is very neatly tied together, with a plethora of decisions you can make in the scenarios of the game and consequence that will unfold because of your actions. Everything is moody and gloomy, as you would expect from such a world. It can hold moments of light-heartedness, and it is definately something that should be experienced and appreciated firsthand.   The gameplay itself is fast paced and very thorough. You need to check every meticulous detail too see if documents are in check and valid, corresponding to the entrant correctly. The difficulty curve in the late game gets even harder as more documents that you need to check pile up as the game progresses.  Should you buy this? If you hold an appreciation for a dark, Orwellian world, absolutely. If you enjoy unique, intuitive gameplay that will keep you on your toes and isn't too pretentious, take it into heavy consideration. It can hold a little less ground when it comes to complete replayability (frankly I can't see myself playing this game for TOO long in say, endless modes, as it can get somewhat repetitive, albeit challenging), but it is still very much an amazing game for it's price and you should seriously buy it if you haven't.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Your first impression of the game will be monotonous and fastidious but very soon you will develop a rhythm of being a proficient immigration inspector.  If you cannot there is an Easy Mode option in settings.  This game requires your undivided attention and quick reflexes; you will have to take notice small details. When you play this game, you are going to enter a mesmerising state of mind and the music is very appeasing; you won't notice how much time has passed.   This game is not just about being a immigration inspector, its about the struggle of making moral choices. Would you condemn this lady to die, with expired passport, by refusing her entry or deprive your sick son of medicine by losing your paycheque? Would you let a wanted murderer pass because revenge driven father wants to kill him or would you get him arrested, where he might not be sentenced justly for his crimes? Would you help the terrorist organisation EZIC over-throw the corrupt government or stay loyal to the dystopian Arstotzka? These are but a few of the question you have to ask yourself. The story is not that long but the best part is that you can start a semi-new game from any day and make different choices. You also have more option as you make progress, such as ability to check fingerprints and full body scan.  This game is not everyone; being an immigration inspector is the most exciting job of all, some may find that boring. If you do not mind doing same thing over and over, then you should definitely give it a try. Even with a linear story, it will get you emotionally engaged with the various choices it presents you.

239030,"Papers, Please","An interesting game, if not quite 'entertaining'. I found its monotony and increasing bureaucracy to be very similar to my real-life in public service. The endless drudgery that will have you violate your job simply to expeirence some change.  It's a thoughtful and interesting game, but I found some aspects needed improvement--the graphics were poor, particularly when you are supposed to recognize someone's gender in a bad drawing. ANd the controls are clunky. My arms are sore after a few hours of play from clicking back and forth, back and forth.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a terrific puzzler developed by Lucas Pope. You work as an inspector for an Arstotzkan border and have to check all of their papers to be sure they are valid for entry.  The graphics of the game are extremely simplistic, lovable and eye catching. After every day, you get to see how your family is doing and have to buy food and/or heat for them. There are many interactions you can have with your family, such as your son having a birthday and you buying a gift for them. Leaving them without food or heat for too long will eventually kill them, but hey, less mouths to feed and warm.  Sometimes, there are terrorist attacks and you must stop them with your tranquilizer. You get a bonus for this. Also, while we're on the topic of terrorists, an infamous group called EZIC will contact you during the game. You will get bonuses from them, and a few of the endings revolve around EZIC. You do not have to do all of what EZIC tells you to do, but it's more enjoyable (in my opinion) following them.  You can upgrade your booth for easier inspecting. Some of the upgrades include pressing tab to open your stamps, space to check their papers for discrepencies, etc.  While there is fun moments, the discrepency detector can be a bit buggy, which could kill the fun. I think overall, Papers, Please is a terrific game and if you have the money lying around do get it.   9.5/10   (Jorji lives!)",1,0

There are 20 different endings in all based on the decisions you make in-game, and along the way you will meet very memorable characters. The game has an amazing feel to it and certainly was worth every hour I put into it, and I plan on playing it much more to unlock all the endings.

239030,"Papers, Please","Your first impression of the game will be monotonous and fastidious but very soon you will develop a rhythm of being a proficient immigration inspector.  If you cannot there is an Easy Mode option in settings.  This game requires your undivided attention and quick reflexes; you will have to take notice small details. When you play this game, you are going to enter a mesmerising state of mind and the music is very appeasing; you won't notice how much time has passed.   This game is not just about being a immigration inspector, its about the struggle of making moral choices. Would you condemn this lady to die, with expired passport, by refusing her entry or deprive your sick son of medicine by losing your paycheque? Would you let a wanted murderer pass because revenge driven father wants to kill him or would you get him arrested, where he might not be sentenced justly for his crimes? Would you help the terrorist organisation EZIC over-throw the corrupt government or stay loyal to the dystopian Arstotzka? These are but a few of the question you have to ask yourself. The story is not that long but the best part is that you can start a semi-new game from any day and make different choices. You also have more option as you make progress, such as ability to check fingerprints and full body scan.  This game is not everyone; being an immigration inspector is the most exciting job of all, some may find that boring. If you do not mind doing same thing over and over, then you should definitely give it a try. Even with a linear story, it will get you emotionally engaged with the various choices it presents you.

It may not make much of a difference to some people, but I'd recommend playing this game with headphones on. Reasons: the soundtrack for this game, although repetitive, is very catchy, adding to the authoritative environment that is Arstotzka. Second, *spoilers* when the opportunities come to use the tranquilizer/sniper gun, the sudden surprise of the alarm sound made me jump and realize how attentive I was looking for descrepancies. As you play through the game multiple times, for the tokens, achievements, endings, or endless mode, you will be able to adapt faster and more efficient ways to correctly grant or deny access to incoming people; it wasn't easy for me my first playthrough, but it began to be easier after a few playthroughts to process about 15 people on most days (except on the days where certain events happen).  My only problem, slight at that, is the last upgrade. I understand it may make it easier for those that use their trackpad on their laptops, or those that find it easier that using the space bar. It's a hit or miss, I didn't find it helpful; if anything, it made finding descrepancies more problematic.   Excellent game, I'd highly recommend this game.   GLORY TO NEW ARSTOTZKA.",1,0

The idea is simple, but as you play, certain conflicts will arise and your ability to decide whether or not a person can pass the border into the country will give you power over who 'wins' and who 'loses.' The game is addicting and provides a challenge later in the game when you have to look out for forgeries, false info, smugglers, international criminals, etc. It has a great soundtrack as well. The player can make decisions that can end the game in 1 of 20 different endings. It's also really interesting to be able to decide if you want to help someone even if it's against what you're supposed to do as an immigration inspector.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is really, really good!  From what I had heard of Papers, Please, I was expecting a very unique game, but also something that was very limited in terms of gameplay and variety. Boy, I was wrong! So, everyone must have heard about the general premise by now. The whole moral conundrum between the people you decide to pass, despite of their document's validity, is a very important aspect. However, there are several different 'storylines' that you come across. And that's where some of the big decisions come into play, as you try to balance family and principle. There are several ways you can play this game, each character you encounter encorporating a different trait of your play style.  I felt genuinely bad with some of the decisions I made. And genuinely good as well! And it's not all that common for a game to make me pause and think about what I'm about to do.   There are some really memorable moments and characters. Overall, you should stick with your decisions, as you definitely feel the repercussions of most of them. Use your better judgement and do good for Arstotzka!  Replayability is certainly there, although I doubt I'll ever do it. I'm quite satisfied with the experience I got out of the game, honestly. However, there are lots of ways where you can choose different! The campaign should remain largely the same, though, regarding the 'filler' moments. Of course, those are necessary for the game to have meaning! I support that, it just hinders replayability, if you deem that necessary.  Definitely give this one a go!",1,0

I hail it for its repetitive yet delightful and terrifying gameplay, the appeal it has to nerds like me, and the fact that it is so unusual and unique. It makes you feel like the character your portray, and makes you get in his head and feel for him. It has an excellent story, and is very much based on decisions you make based on what you think is right. Or fun. Or funny.  I don't know, there's something that's just so great that I just can't describe about this game. I think it's confidence. You actually feel like a bad-a** sitting there in your booth, comparing documents to one another, and stamping passports. The game is very much a power trip.  I tend to play some games to get all achievements, and I must admit that once I got them all I had no desire to return. There is little to no replayability. However, I played the game for 20 hours and consider it 20 hours very well spent. Buy it on a sale and giggle at the dialogue. And read all the dialogue. And, no spoilers, but decide whether or not you are loyal to your government or not and play like that consistently, it will severely determine the game's ending, of which there are 20. I have a google document showing what all of my 20 endings were. Yes, yes, don't worry, I'll show you if you want.  If you get this game... which you should... good luck.

With your tiny screen and limited controls, you feel like the man watching the border, what little power you may have is cramped and pushed under the thumb of the government overseers. You are pushed to match up an array of information from various documents, speed and correctness being key to your income. Rules change regularly, and you have to balance the needs of the bureaucracy, your family, and the people. Maybe you let someone through the border without proper documents. Will their thanks be worth possibly going without heat or food tonight? Will that gift even last, or will you be found by the police and taken into custody?  It's an incredibly engaging game.

The story is as follows: You're a citizen of the imaginary country Arstotzka. Your name is pulled in a labor lottery and as a result, you've been assigned to a border checkpoint. Each day you meet different people who you must, based on whatever rules are in your rulebook, allow or not allow them into your country. At the end of each day you must decide how to spend what little money you make on your family (heating, food, medicine, etc...). Each day is a timed event so you must look over papers rather quickly.  As each day passes another rule gets added or the number of papers you must examine increases. Eventually body searches and detaining are involved as well. By the end of the campaign your desk can get quite cluttered with passports, entry visas, vaccination papers, emissary ids, and various other forms and certificates.  There are also various storylines each day. You meet people in different organizations, each seeking your assistance, and you must decide who you want to trust. This helps keep things more interesting.  What you do along the way does affect the ending you receive.   I like indie games. Lately some of them have been better than AAA titles.

The feel that peoples lives depend on the choices you make really aides this game. To keep you with things to do the game adds new challenges and difficulties every day and an endless mode after you've completed the story.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is one of my favorite games. It's different from any other game I have played. Even though the graphics are really plain the atmosphere is incredibly deep and you feel as if you really were someone working for an evil government. You can decide whether you are on the government's side and gain money and fame or if you prefer working against the government by helping the rebel group. There are many endings you can get and it took some tries for me to get the happy ending. I would always recommend this game. But be warned, to me it's not a game you casually play without thinking. It really means work and after about two hours of playing without a break I usually can't go on and have to stop. You have to concern every detail and compare a lot of information.

239030,"Papers, Please","Surprisingly enjoyable for a game about bureaucratic red tape. It's essentially a memory game where you try to spot possible discrepancies in entrants' documentation before letting them through. You can always double check all of the rules and notifications you've received, but doing so will slow you down and you will earn less money for processing fewer entrants. The game has a fair about of cynical humor in it, the challenges are changed up often enough that it keeps you on your toes, and the few characters are as memorable and enjoyable as any I've seen in other games.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a game that seems to undersand that the player has morality and encourages them to follow it but with the result being that their actions also affect their pay check, too many citations you lose pay or even fall into debt.

You have the option to aid a rebellion or just follow orders among other things, each stamped passport could be terrorist you missed or a agent of the rebellion you forgot about. Papers, Please has amazing replay value and with twenty endings it's not surprising that it does.

It would be nice knowing what endings (number) I have unlocked",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","In Papers, Please you play an unnamed immigration control officer on the border of a dystopian soviet state called Arstotzka. The game consists of processing a line of proposed entrants to the country as they shuffle up to your booth, peer in with their 16bit faces and present you documents needed to enter. You then need to scrutinise these documents for discrepancies before either approving or denying entry. Firstly they need the right papers, then these papers need to be checked to make sure that they are factual (a passport with a different sex to the person for example). You can also choose to detain people if you so wish, at which point they are dragged off by the guards never to be seen again. The documents required change on a daily basis as political situations change in the country.  The consequences of letting through or denying someone incorrectly is a fine on your daily earnings. At the end of each work day you go home to your assigned apartment and depending on how the day went have to make decisions as to whether to heat or feed your family or if you can afford the medication required to keep your family from getting sick. The game never quite gives you enough money and when I played last night I never had enough money for rent, food, heating and medicine in one single day meaning you have to juggle with these most basic needs.  There is a larger story that unfolds across the game as you continue playing involving a terrorist faction from a neighbouring state that changes the way you have to process certain people, and a shadowy mysterious organisation that pass you cryptic messages. They are trying to bring down the government and attract attention from the ministry who turn up to your booth asking questions, you can choose who to help and who not to help and all your decisions have consequences.   The day to day stuff might seem mundane, but you get paid per process so you have to weigh running through people quickly against the possibility of missing something... its a game that can harshly punish you for cutting the wrong corner while constantly pressuring you to cut corners. Various events occur during the game, one event I had was after processing the first person in the line he told me that he was escaping persecution and would be killed if he returned and his wife was behind him. His wife didn't have the right papers and I had to decide whether to grant entry (and take the financial hit myself) or play by the book and deny entry. The pixelated people plead, bluff and beg to get their way - and honestly I've never felt like such a monster as playing this game.   Is it fun? Well sort of, certainly more than it sounds anyway. The document inspection part of the game is oddly compelling, the perfectionist in me wanting to get it right all the time but with so many variables making this incredibly difficult. The constant feedback of going back home with not quite enough money pressuring you into going quicker and inevitably making more mistakes. The small events added something new every day which made me feel very involved in the game - as if the fate of these people actually mattered. I didn't get far enough to see the overall story unfold to the end, after accepting a large bribe (without actually carrying out the deed) and moving to a better house I was reported by my neighbour and thrown in jail by the ministry of income pending a full investigation. Apparently there are multiple endings based on the decisions made throughout the game giving it a level of re-playability.",1,0

'Holy ♥♥♥♥ nuggets, what have I been doing the past few hours.' Yeah this game is good. Not just good but really good. There are two big parts that make this game really good. The first is just the gameplay. I'm not sure how they did it but the but checking the papers in your little booth is a very engrossing process and is very easy to learn how to point and click the varying paper work is easy and the addition of more paper work as the game progresses adds to a more challenging momentum without taking away from the game. The next strenth is the moral choices in the game. Now most games have some kind of moral choice, usually something about killing rainbow mcpuffins or not, which can easily bereplaced by a light switch at the end of the game saying what ending you want. Papers, Please makes it really hard to be a good perason. You can either reunite a couple who has been divided by the split, but you get paid by how many people you get through the booth, and if you let the wrong people in you cant pay for the food and medicine for your family. I can't even begin to describe all of the nail biting delimas that the game through me because of this small amount of context.

The gameplay is simple you stamp passports yes or no, but then more documents are added to make you job as border control harder, and soon you take down attackers with a traq gun. then the story with 'the order' can get interesting but you should play it to find that out. I've also never felt bad for characters you don't even see. You need to take care of your family at the end of each day they could get sick, cold, hungry,etc. If you don't fill these needs they will die.

From what I had heard of Papers, Please, I was expecting a very unique game, but also something that was very limited in terms of gameplay and variety. Boy, I was wrong! So, everyone must have heard about the general premise by now. The whole moral conundrum between the people you decide to pass, despite of their document's validity, is a very important aspect. However, there are several different 'storylines' that you come across. And that's where some of the big decisions come into play, as you try to balance family and principle. There are several ways you can play this game, each character you encounter encorporating a different trait of your play style.  I felt genuinely bad with some of the decisions I made. And genuinely good as well! And it's not all that common for a game to make me pause and think about what I'm about to do.   There are some really memorable moments and characters. Overall, you should stick with your decisions, as you definitely feel the repercussions of most of them. Use your better judgement and do good for Arstotzka!  Replayability is certainly there, although I doubt I'll ever do it. I'm quite satisfied with the experience I got out of the game, honestly. However, there are lots of ways where you can choose different! The campaign should remain largely the same, though, regarding the 'filler' moments.

239030,"Papers, Please",Beautiful game in both graphics and story. Every choice and misread name can snowball into an ending that will either suprise you or give you a sense of almost guilt. Great game a a perfect time killer when you can focus. 9/10,1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is really, really good!  From what I had heard of Papers, Please, I was expecting a very unique game, but also something that was very limited in terms of gameplay and variety. Boy, I was wrong! So, everyone must have heard about the general premise by now. The whole moral conundrum between the people you decide to pass, despite of their document's validity, is a very important aspect. However, there are several different 'storylines' that you come across. And that's where some of the big decisions come into play, as you try to balance family and principle. There are several ways you can play this game, each character you encounter encorporating a different trait of your play style.  I felt genuinely bad with some of the decisions I made. And genuinely good as well! And it's not all that common for a game to make me pause and think about what I'm about to do.   There are some really memorable moments and characters. Overall, you should stick with your decisions, as you definitely feel the repercussions of most of them. Use your better judgement and do good for Arstotzka!  Replayability is certainly there, although I doubt I'll ever do it. I'm quite satisfied with the experience I got out of the game, honestly. However, there are lots of ways where you can choose different! The campaign should remain largely the same, though, regarding the 'filler' moments. Of course, those are necessary for the game to have meaning! I support that, it just hinders replayability, if you deem that necessary.  Definitely give this one a go!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I haven't played this game much, but so far I like it and would recommend it to others who are looking for something different. It's very much an indie game and it really is a 'job simulator' or a 'paperwork simulator' so you would think that it would be pretty boring. Well, as my teenage daughter said when watching my wife play, 'it's sort of boring, but sort of interesting.'  I think what makes the game interesting is the story of a working class man in a fictional communist country trying to make ends meet at his bureaucratic job that pays him peanuts. He's got his own problems to deal with keeping his family fed, warm, and healthy. BUt as he goes through the motions everyday of stamping passports, allowing or denying people at his checkpoint, he is confronted sometimes with other people's problems. What does he do? Does he just follow the rules of his employer/government and cover his own butt? Or does he sometimes break the rules when seemingly honest people might be in trouble and might need help from him? I think it's this tension that makes the game interesting. It's not always clear what is the right thing to do.   You have to have a quick eye and pay attention to details in this game since you can make a little more money the more people you proces each day. But if you make too many mistakes and break the rules, then your bosses penalize you. So you have a lot of incentive to be merciless to those who sometimes approach you for help. So the game sort of encourages you to be a cold-hearted bureacratic machine and makes it hard to do what you think is the right thing to help someone in need. I think that is part of the tension that makes the game good. You can let someone through who doesn't have the right paperwork and your bosses will give you a warning about that, and that puts pressure on you to not make any other followup mistakes or you'll lose some of the little money you make.  The pixelated, retro graphics that are in this game seem to be all the rage these days with indie games these days, and I honestly am getting tired of the trend, but in this case the visuals really work well because they enhance the bleakness of the setting of the game.  This is definitely a game to try out if you are looking for a different gaming experience, especially if you can get it on sale.",1,0

You may think its some boring, old, trash 8-bit game but really it takes skill, memorization, and puzzle solving to be good in this game. My friends thought that in this game, all you do is choose who gets through the border and who does not. WRONG. Basically, in this game you must find discrepencies in people's passports. Can't find one? Let them through. Found one? You can detain, fingerprint, search, deny and do much more to people in this game. ALTHOUGH!

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers please is a game where you find yourself playing as a man who works at the border of Arstotzka, the greatest country. In this game, you make barely enough money to feed your family and keep them warm and healthy, you work a dangerous job at Grestin border checkpoint. You start off at the beginning with easy levels and simple tasks. But as days go by, the job at the GBC ( Grestin border checkpoint ) get's harder as some people may have fake, wrong or outdated passports or any other documents, every day gets harder than the last, its one of the things that makes this game chalenging. If you let someone in when they we're not clear for entry or If you send someone back from where they came when they we're clear, you will get a citation, get 3 of those and you get a 5$ penalty for doing a bad job, this is terrible because money is very hard to come by in the world of papers please. You must find a balance between keeping your family safe and your bank account stable. In papers please, you can chose to help, ignore or arrest criminals, terrorists or agressive people, but remember, the choices you make change the endings. You can also accept or ignore bribes, let in people other people begged you to let in and meet some very VERY friendly people *cough* jori *cough*   This was an amazing game to play and i highly recommend playing this game, Glory to Arstotzka",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Honestly, this is probably the best 'simulator' game I have ever played in my life, I say 'simulator', because it's mainly based on your choices of a border-control station in a fictional country in 1982, as it says, it IS a thriller, and it IS a documentary, a very choice-based documentary.  Your character has no name, and you only know your character is a male.  The story is very choice-driven, as stated above.  Your actions can either get you arrested.. killed, etc.  It's not the best game ever, but I can say it's the best simulator I have ever played.  The gameplay can be a bit.. repetative.. but that's the only flaw in this game.  9/10, it's a perfect Indie Game, I recommend this to all on the verge of buying it or not.",1,0

For a in-game month, you are responsible for reviewing the documents of people trying to cross over the border into your home country of Arstotzka. Along the way, you'll encounter fraudulent paperwork, terrorism and genuinely desperate individuals who you'll be responsible for either turning a blind eye to (and getting penalized over) or taking care of in cold, heartless fashion. You'll also have to manage your finances to a small degree; if you make too many mistakes, your pay will be severely docked and you won't be able to afford to provide for your family.  The game is surprisingly challenging as the game goes on, with an increasing amount of rules to follow and increasing sophistication of forgery. Most of your character's time is spent in a space no bigger than a toll booth, and you'll have to juggle a myriad of different papers as time goes on, with any oversight being as bad as any other.  As mentioned, the game takes place over a month, but the game allows you to revisit any day along the month and branch a path. You'll probably want to do this as there are plety of different things to see depending on how you interact with the people who come to your booth. There are, in total, twenty different endings to see.

It puts you in the shoes of a man with responsiblities struggling to give his family a good life, in a communist nation. The Devs did a really good job making this amazing game.

You investigate into the finer details of individuals and decide what to do with them. Be warned, you make a mistake and you will be penalised by Glorious Arstotzka.  Things are not as easy as it seems. You come across moral decisions which you must make that could help or hurt individuals. You have a family to take care of and must spend your money carefully as you earn only so much as to the amount of people you process a day.

239030,"Papers, Please","A little while back, on a lark, I deciced to give the indie game 'Papers, Please' a try. The concept looked interesting, so I figured it was worth a shot.  In my mind, I think of it as the 'Checkpoint Charlie Simulator'. :)  The game takes place in a fictitious, mid-80's Eastern Bloc-ish region of the world where your homeland of Arstotska has finally gotten around to opening its borders with Kolechia after a long bitter war. You play an unnamed citizen who has won the labor lottery and been assigned as the checkpoint inspector of those entrance points. Your family is 'generously' housed in a Class-8 dwelling (snerk).  The graphics are old school (purposefully so, I'm guessing), but it doesn't detract from the details, which is good because the game is all about details.  From the time you punch in to the time the checkpoint counter is shuttered, you deal with a never ending stream of people attempting to cross the border into Arstotska. It is up to you to grant or deny access based on their paperwork and the policies to be enforced, as determined by the Ministry of Admissions (MoA) at the start of each day.  The first day is simple -- you are instructed to permit all Arstotskan citizens to cross and deny everyone else. Each country has a distinct passport cover that you'll soon recognize and it is easy to automatically stamp DENY on any that aren't Arstotska. For Arstotska passports, you have to spend a few more moments making sure that it isn't expired, the photos match, and the issuing city is valid.  Yeah, seriously, someone made a government desk job into a game. :) So having said that, why on earth would anyone bother playing something like this past the first 5 minutes? After all, we've all seen the soul-crushed individuals who work at the DMV and post office...why would we want to play a simulator on that sort of drudgery? :)  Well, for one thing, there is actually a storyline. Your perspective never changes -- you'll spend the game basically working in your booth, looking out at the snaking line of hopeful immigrants and visitors, the armed soldiers keeping watch, and of course the interior of the booth itself. However, things happen around you. There are terrorist attacks, internal unrest, new edicts from the MoA in response to these events, and these all affect you and your work. And this is where it gets interesting.  You see, you have a family to support. You get paid $5 for each person you successfully process. If you're REALLY efficient, you can process maybe up to 15 people per game day (time moves very quickly, the booth clock spins like a stopwatch -- each 'day' lasts maybe 5-10 minutes of real life time). Improper handling of applicants (either unwarranted denials or incorrect admissions) result in a citation. You get 2-3 free mistakes, and then each subsequent citation that day will dock $5 off your pay. The money you make goes towards paying rent, heat, food, and medicine for your family at the end of each day.  The rent will rise, family members will get sick and need medicine, and the ever expanding rules from the MoA make it harder for you to quickly process applicants. You must always pay rent...but you can opt NOT to spend money on food, or heat, or medicine if you have to. Of course, if you do that, your family members (and it looks like you have a wife, son, uncle, and MIL) will start to suffer or even die.  As the game progresses and the entry rules become more complex, you will get additional options in your booth -- you can interrogate people on discrepancies in their paperwork (some are kind of funny, like a bald fat man trying to pass through with a passport listing his gender as 'F' -- really??), you can have them searched for weapons or contraband, you can even in some cases have them detained by the soldiers, depending on how suspicious the discrepancy is.  Some times they'll offer you bribes. Given how close to the wire you are in expenses, it can get awfully tempting, especially if your son is about to die from his illness because you can't afford medicine and you have 'free' citations left for that day.  Some times you have to make a moral decision -- like a woman who slips you a note with her passport saying that the man in line after her is trafficking her to a brothel and asks for your help. If his papers are in order, do you deny him entry anyway (and earn a citation)? Let him through because it's not your concern? Spend precious time finding a way to detain him?  You start recognizing certain characters (most are randomly generated, but story-based events have recurring characters) and if you're smart, you'll start piecing together clues that something's up. When the time comes, what will your big decision be?  It turns out that this game actually has multiple endings. On my first try, I took too long at my work, didn't make enough money, spent too long interrogating some people, had my uncle die of illness because I couldn't afford the medicine, went into debt, and promptly got sent to jail for debt delinquency. An ignominious end. Well, at least they didn't shoot me (that's a possible ending, too, apparently, for a number of end game scenarios :)  There is also an 'Easy Mode' that grants you a $20 crutch for each day. That helps A LOT, though you can still ♥♥♥♥ it away if you don't earn enough during the day to cover your expenses.  Reading back through this review, I can see it is still hard to convey why I find the game fun. Well, maybe fun isn't exactly the right word for it. To be fair, it's not un-fun. It is challenging. For now I find it rather compelling, too. It's an odd mix of feeling like you are welding a lot of power (people will beg you to let them go rather than being detained...etc) versus feeling powerless at the same time (every time I stamp my decision, I tense in anticipation of hearing that damned citation being printed because I missed some detail!), and just general curiosity of how the story will unfold.  It could be that part of the appeal is that back in the 80s, I remember watching Cold War Era spy movies where the characters have to bluff or sneak their way past border crossings and checkpoints, and wondering what life is like for the indifferent (or suspicious) clerk on the other side of the window. I guess now I have a better idea. :)",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Have you ever wanted to work in security customs and border control? Have you ever wanted to be responsible for controlling who comes in and out of your country? This game simulates just that. It may use cheap 2D, 16 color graphics, but in a way, a game like this doesn't need to be fancy. All you have to do is make sure you follow regulations, make sure all citizens have the proper papers, make sure they have followed the guide lines (Expiration Date, proper photo, correct city information, etc.) Make sure no one passes that are not allowed in the country. This game tests your ability to remember rules and watch for inconsistant information on documents. If you think you would make a good borders patrol, then test your knowledge and skill with this game. It starts easy, but you have to remember more as you progress through the game. You not only have to watch for face versus photo and expiration date, but you also have to remember which cities are valid places to get papers as well as checking to make sure all fields are filled in. How well you work determines how much money you make to help your family. This is not so different from real life. Work well and do your job correctly, your family will be well taken care of.

239030,"Papers, Please","TLDR: Papers, Please is a fantastic way to spend a free hour or two here and there, it's one of my all-time favorites and worth the price whether it's on sale or not.  Pros: +Great atmosphere +Challenging decisions that really impact the ending +Interesting mini-puzzles and events  Cons: -Some nitpicky details  Papers, Please is one of my favorite games to date. Upon first starting the game, you're greeted with a booming Arstotzkan theme and immediately dumped into the thick atmosphere of the game. It's a fairly rare occasion for a game with such a simple and pixelated graphic style to be as immersive as this one, which really puts you into your role as a winner of the labor lottery.  Along the way, you come accross a ton of characters, many of which forcing you to make big decisions that could impact the life of you or the family you're working to care for. What's worse is that most times you won't see the effect of your decision until days after, leaving you tense and concerned that soon enough, your world will crumble around you.  Some of the characters that come by will make you think harder than others, some giving you challenges on a surface level, whilst others force you to decipher more thoroughly, meaning you have to keep up with whatever puzzle is presented, and in the meantime maintain the efforts of your job.  The only con I would mark for this game is the small details that you can get caught up on, like making sure that people have the correct issuing cities and the like.  Overall, I'd rate this game a 9/10 and definitely recommend it to anybody who's interested.",1,0

You decide whether someone passes through the border and sometimes you need to make difficult decisions which goes against your orders.   An average day at your job can be like this: Woman steps up to the booth. Wearing lipstick, jewelry and a cute hat. She hands you the papers and it says she's a man. Are the papers correct? She claims so. You ask 'her' to undress and you recieve a photo of a naked man wearing lipstick, jewelry and a cute hat. So what do you do?

239030,"Papers, Please","BWOOOMP, BWOMP. BWOOOMP, BWOMP.  If you told me that a game based all around immigration and passport checking would become one of my lasting favorites, I would have thought you were crazy. But with the favorable Zero Puncuation review of it, I had to seriously try it. It's easy to make a fun-sounding game that's boring, but it's something special to make a boring-sounding game that's actually really engaging.  You play as an Arstotzkian citizen, who has been picked by the labor lottery to handle the busy checkpoint between it and the neighboring country of Kolechia. It is your task to handle the influx of people from their dirt to your soil, making sure their paperwork is in order, and that nobody's trying to sneak in drugs, bombs, or pose as another sex. Arstotzkia has a zero tolerance policy towards these misdeeds, and letting that in is a citation. You don't want citations and you want to get as many people processed as possible. You've got a family to feed, rent to pay up, and heating for the cold winters.  As you progress though this game, the Ministry of Travel imposes more and more rules and regulations that you have to follow. Every little slip up that you make against their rules earns you citiations. The first two are just warnings, but soon after your precious pay for the day will be docked. Resentment is high in the Kolechian lands, with bombers and terrorists ever so often attempting to intrude on your soil for their nerfarious causes, and you have to stop these attacks with the goverment sanctioned tranquilizer gun whenever they come.  Yet, though the small and bleak window of your position, you have to make a lot of suprsingly moral choices. There are a lot of good people in this world, and a lot of people simply looking to reunite with their estranged families, or honest citizens like you who let their passports lapse or providing the wrong documentation. You follow the rules, right? Would you let these people in despite their misdeeds?  You might not consider this a 'fun' game, but it is one that sinks its hooks deeply into you. It's one that is sure to provoke honest discussion and honest thoughts after you play. Multiple endings provide a reason to replay this game, and they are intuitive to figure out and fun to execute on. My main complaint is that the upgrade system is extremly superficial, only providing shortcuts that could have been in the game to begin with, and which ultimatly aren't that useful in comparision to the credits cost.  I recommend this game at its full price of $10, and this is a must-have if it ever goes on sale. Thanks to this game, I end up mixing up Arstotzka and the similarly named empire of Arkhosia, both of which are very different. Well, maybe. Glory to both anyway.",1,0

What little story the game does present to you is extremely basic and unfulfilling, definitely not worth the time investment, not to mention the premise for the game is heavily inspired (some might even say ripped off) from classic works such as Orewell's 1984. Obvious moral choices serve only to hinder you, and as a result the game can tend to leave you feeling lonely and depressed. On top of this, obvious quips in the game are more insulting than they are funny, such as the obviously Soviet Bloc world map using the United States of America instead of Eastern Europe, and the unfair treatment of transgendered people.

It's a sort of strategy/simulation game in which you have to determine, using ever more complex inspection and interrogation techniques, who is/is not genuinely permitted into most glorious nation of Arstotzka. It sounds simple, but the game never stops thowing plot twists, moral dilemmas and new mechanics into the mix. It feels like a lot of thought (and an incredibly original idea in the first instance) went into making this game. Special mention must go to the writing, not only for it's brilliant pacing but for sheer authenticity. The characters speak as you would imagine a Russian in an English-language movie to speak, which makes it feel real without alienating first-language English speakers.  My friend's first reaction whilst watching me play as the protagonist, a humdrum average citizen border inspector, was 'this looks too much like actual work to me'. In a way, he's right. However, as with anything, the better you get at it the more satisfying it becomes. It will keep you coming back too, as there are multiple endings which are eventually reachable from any point in the game.

It changes every day, and there are scripted events, so you kind of play for the events in each day, and they're pretty fun to see too. The interactive-ness of the game kind of leaves the interpretation of the game's message and overall story to you, allowing you to look at the smaller scale stuff in a bigger picture, putting emphasis on whatever, which is really well done and has some feel of a book. This game feels really nice, and is really well executed and has a lot of care.  I know what you may be thinking, 'Games revolving around gimmicks are lame and have no fun beyond the first 15 minutes!', and you're right, but this game is one of the few that goes for a mature feel, appealing to an adult audience with an adult topics, with an interesting take on the gimmick genre (one with gameplay alone giving a really strong tone to the game), which was a risky move on their part but really nice to play.

You have to earn enough money to feed your family (without alerting the secret police) each day, which can be difficult at times. Some days you have to go hungry, others you have to go without heating because your son needs medicine and others you can afford all the luxury's your small proletariat family can think of because you managed to rake in enough money through corrupt practices at work, or shooting a terrorist before he kills your friend, the guard. So many choices are weaved into the game as subtle moral decisions. Do you feed your family or allow the wife of the man you just approved escape the tyranny of Obristan or some such place. Will you be a good patriotic citizen, devoted to the dear leader or will you attempt to subvert the regime that you work for, the very regime that has claimed to have liberated you from wage slavery and yet has put you into it itself. The choices in this game are a mirror image of Fable, and by that I mean the evil opposite kind of mirror, the kind with parallel universes inside. Fable has you make yes or no decisions that are clearly laid out to you as decisions, one emblazened in fire, the other surrounded by angelic light. In Papers Please, everything is gray.

Once you learn how the game works it gets fun and sometimes even suspenseful. Calling out discrepansies is so much fun once you're certain something is wrong. You feel like you're in power. Papers Please has its own internal storyline with many different endings that you can follow.  At times you will have to choose to be the devil's advocate or a benevolent peon.,1,0

There is no variety and if this was your job in real life, you'd probably be on anti-depressants. So presumably then, with such a boring concept, this is an awful game right? No, actually it's one of the most addictive games I've ever played. The frustrating thign from the point of a reviewer is it's impossible to explain why. It's got a good sense of humour and a so-so storyline but it's not that which keeps you coming back, it's the sense of achievement that you get from the game.

You struggle to feed your family and you get the smallest income and you have to make tough choices. You have to decide losing your paycheck and make moral choices and lose income and not be able to feed and buy medicine for your family or ignore morality and get income to help your family live.

And I guarentee you, unless you're some kind of Jack Thompson - Katie Couric abominational schmuck, you won't find this game fun or okay if not depressing. Seldom did I ever think I would be able to enjoy such a hard, challenging and all in all, depressing game. But, surprisingly enough, I eventually became addicted. There's something about this game that makes it fun, and I've pretty much figured it out - it's that rewarding sense you get from picking up such an inconspicuous detail, like the fact that his name was Marlin Estevez and not Martin Estevez. Then, there's the not so subtle fakings (Jorji, I'm looking at you) that are more funny that anything.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is not 'fun' so much as it is 'interesting'. Check papers, deny or pass, repeat. Sounds boring, but really it is pretty gripping. You have to earn enough money to feed your family (without alerting the secret police) each day, which can be difficult at times. Some days you have to go hungry, others you have to go without heating because your son needs medicine and others you can afford all the luxury's your small proletariat family can think of because you managed to rake in enough money through corrupt practices at work, or shooting a terrorist before he kills your friend, the guard. So many choices are weaved into the game as subtle moral decisions. Do you feed your family or allow the wife of the man you just approved escape the tyranny of Obristan or some such place. Will you be a good patriotic citizen, devoted to the dear leader or will you attempt to subvert the regime that you work for, the very regime that has claimed to have liberated you from wage slavery and yet has put you into it itself. The choices in this game are a mirror image of Fable, and by that I mean the evil opposite kind of mirror, the kind with parallel universes inside. Fable has you make yes or no decisions that are clearly laid out to you as decisions, one emblazened in fire, the other surrounded by angelic light. In Papers Please, everything is gray. The game has a fine sense of humour about it, and thus it recieves my approval.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is weird. The only way I can describe it is a puzzle/RPG. But that doesnt do it justice.  You are a border guard in a fictional Iron Curtain-esque land. You have to look at people's documents to let them in your nation. Or not. The more people you process, the more money you make. But you will get cited if you let someone in with say an expired passport. Too many citations, and you get your salary penalized. And since youre a poor proletariat, you can barely afford to keep your family fed and housed as it is.  The interface is really intuitive. If you see a discrepancy IE an expired passport, click on 'investigate discrepancy' then on the expired passport date, then on the clock/ calendar in the corner of your booth and then on your microphone to ask the person to explain.   At the end of every day, you see how much you made vs how much you spent taking care of your family and paying for rent, food, and heat(you dont have to pay for food and heat everyday). Over time you can also buy booth upgrades (keyboard shortcutrs that make it faster to process people) and maybe some medicine if a family member gets sick.  Alright, so whats the big deal? Well, theres an interesting story too. Each day as you go to work things change, security gets tighter or looser depending on international (there are a few other bordering nations) politics, terrorist attacks, spies showing up ect. So one day you might be asked to 'search all people from a certain land' and then 'check all work visas' the next day or whatever. Its gets slowly more complicated as the story progresses, and you have choices to make about who to let through/help. And your actions can affect outcomes or even the endings. Let someone through even though they dont have the correct info, and it might affect your interactions with another person later.  Its weird, unique and engrossing. I'm less than half way through the story (I think it goes for 31 days) and I'm already really interested in playing more to see what happens.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Gimmicky game that has a genre with a reputation of being kind of bad (according to me, at least (See Goat Simulator and Surgeon Simulator)), but this game has a more mature feel with the idea of the gameplay mechanics being a factor for how this game plays out, giving the game's feel with you playing a campaign being a paper-pusher the entire time, which actually isn't bad. It changes every day, and there are scripted events, so you kind of play for the events in each day, and they're pretty fun to see too. The interactive-ness of the game kind of leaves the interpretation of the game's message and overall story to you, allowing you to look at the smaller scale stuff in a bigger picture, putting emphasis on whatever, which is really well done and has some feel of a book. This game feels really nice, and is really well executed and has a lot of care.  I know what you may be thinking, 'Games revolving around gimmicks are lame and have no fun beyond the first 15 minutes!', and you're right, but this game is one of the few that goes for a mature feel, appealing to an adult audience with an adult topics, with an interesting take on the gimmick genre (one with gameplay alone giving a really strong tone to the game), which was a risky move on their part but really nice to play.

I'd also like to point out it has the greatest save system I have ever seen. Not much, I know, but now I look at other games save files and just think hateful things.  The retro pixel graphics are a little more blocky that I would of liked, but its got its own style and color scheme that really set it apart from all the other pixelilated games.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please, Lucas Pope's masterpiece, is my favourite game of all time. Because that's a rather grand statement, I'm going to analyse it from several directions, to fully convey my reasoning.  -MUSIC- The opening theme of Papers, Please is clever. Very clever. It's use of heavily synthesised instruments harmonises with the early PC-game aesthetic, creating a very comforting, almost nostalgic feeling. It's memorable, instantly recognisable, and effective. Furthermore, the citation sound effect (yes I'm including that in music) has given me recurring nightmares. It is the sound that makes me sit up straight, that makes the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. The only sound to do that beforehand, is the noise that is made when Snake gets spotted and an exclamation mark appears above your head.  -GAMEPLAY- It's challenging to make something simple seem complex. It is to my great pleasure, therefore, for me to say this game is complex. Not only is this game complex, but it's hard. My god this is difficult. I'd say for a £6.99 game, this is one of the games which I have been most satisfied with the playtime. For those unaware of the game's key focus, you are challenged to match up different pieces of information on peoples passports, identity cards and tickets in a border control booth. If you spot any discrepancies, you don't let the person through. It's really that simple. When it comes to the later levels, you realise that it really isn't that simple. Juggling up to 10 documents is honestly a nightmare, whilst simultaneously being aware of storyline characters to look out for.  -STORY- Papers, Please is a choice-based story-driven game. Based on who you allow through the border and what you do with the money you earn, you can unlock 1 of multiple endings. Some of these include the destruction of the border, being imprisoned, and becoming the member of a secret order and escaping with members of your family. Because of the authenticity of this iron-curtain-esque atmosphere, you will be affected by this game as if it's a real environment. This higher power of dictators and leaders is constantly looming over you, along with the anticipation of war. One of the many beauties of this game is that it strongly limits the amount of information given about the reasons for immigration to Arstotzka, leaving it both up to your imagination, and your ability to pick up on subtle hints to decide why. It's an incredibly delicate story about an incredibly brutal topic.  -CONCLUSION- In my opinion, Papers, Please is one of the greatest games ever made. This will always be criticised as an opinion, largely due to the fact that it's a relatively short indie game with very humble-looking graphics and simple coding. It's not a feat of technological greatness, but it is an prime example of what gaming should be. It's a work of art, and my favourite game of all time. If you can manage to buy it, then do so. It's a game to be savoured and appreciated over a length of time, and by as many people as possible.  Papers, Please - 10/10 'A work of genius, and a masterpiece'",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Arrest and detain all doubters of Papers, Please!  Never played anything like it. It's a sort of strategy/simulation game in which you have to determine, using ever more complex inspection and interrogation techniques, who is/is not genuinely permitted into most glorious nation of Arstotzka. It sounds simple, but the game never stops thowing plot twists, moral dilemmas and new mechanics into the mix. It feels like a lot of thought (and an incredibly original idea in the first instance) went into making this game. Special mention must go to the writing, not only for it's brilliant pacing but for sheer authenticity. The characters speak as you would imagine a Russian in an English-language movie to speak, which makes it feel real without alienating first-language English speakers.  My friend's first reaction whilst watching me play as the protagonist, a humdrum average citizen border inspector, was 'this looks too much like actual work to me'. In a way, he's right. However, as with anything, the better you get at it the more satisfying it becomes. It will keep you coming back too, as there are multiple endings which are eventually reachable from any point in the game. And you can return to previous points in the game to take it in a new direction.  A truly fascinating and engrossing game. Certainly much better than I was expecting it to be!",1,0

Unexpected encounters and hard choices are awaiting you,the game being kept alive by introducing new rules at the start of almost each day you play,while also getting harder,so do not expect a smooth gameplay in which you have to check if the passport is expired and aprove immigrants based on whether you like their faces or not,but a gameplay in which you have to deal with the problems surrounding the checkpoint:shooting terrorists,arresting suspicious people,checking fingerprints and so on.It is indeed a nice game,has many endings based on the way you play and a few hidden achievements that are fun to obtain.  Play it,it is worth a try.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Playing 'Papers, Please' is a very realistic, gritty simulation of the responsibility any security, immigrations and sanctions personnel faces on a day-to-day basis. And I say this as someone who works in this line. The sheer amount of information you have to sift through and the meticulous attention to detail that is needed, are staggering. 'Papers, Please' manages to capture the uncertainty and pressure inspectors face, where their decisions determine the number of violations and fines their companies are burdened with. This is exacerbated in this game, as it is set in an era without aid from technology and the only defence are your human, error-prone eyes.  Unexpected situations like surprise terrorist attacks and bombs during what seems to be a Business-As-Usual day, gave me a very realistic sinking feeling of terror. Moral dilemmas also present themselves: Do you let in a known criminal even though all his papers check out? Do you deny someone with incomplete documents who will die if they go back to their home country? Are you a rulebook stickler or a compassionate soul? Or suspicious of everyone?  There is a never a dull moment as you race against the clock to screen immigrantion documents perfectly and precisely. 'Papers, Please' is a truly immersive experience.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a simplistic masterpiece of straddling lines and juxtaposition.  Attacking the dark subject of oppressive, totalitarian/dictatorship governments isn't quite as depressing when done with broken English, cookie-cutter pixel-people, and hilarious immigrants. The impersonality of the character you play - a nameless border inspector - and his job - turning countless people away from the border - allows the player to make the character his/her own through imagination and the decisions made during the work-day. One playthrough you may be a mindless drone, dedicated to country and government, following every rule to the t. The next you could be a rebel, aligning with guerilla groups to thwart your evil government. Maybe you're an altruist, taking every opportunity you can to help the unfortunate people seeking to cross your border, even when it means your family may have to go without heat for a night. This is where the seeming impersonality of the game gives it another advantage; while you must remove yourself from many a situation when denying one entry to your country, while most of the game is based upon reducing people down to ID supplements and passports, accepting and denying as names and faces bleed together, you still have a family to take care of, and still make the occasional friend on the job, have an authentic connection with a person. And when most interaction is cold and impersonal, that occasional friendship means all the more. Deciding how to respond when a rebel group asks you to assassinate someone seems all the more important when the entire day was spent in a mindless tedium of passports and ID cards. Yet while you may not have expected it out of yourself, deciding to aid a drug smuggler when it will allow your wife and son to eat dinner that night suddenly becomes a very easy decision.  This is a casual game to slip into, but once you’re playing, it requires intense concentration, as you try to process as many people as possible in a given day while scrutinizing numerous pieces of paper for the tiniest discrepancy. It is a simple, mindless game on the surface, yet at its core challenges the player to consider human rights and the consequences of his/her decisions from personal to international scales.

239030,"Papers, Please","People complain alot about this game and point out many of its flaws, and yes, some of those flaws are evident. But, none of these flaws ever detracted from my overall experience of the game. In Papers Please, you play as a border control officer in a made up communist country known as Arstotzka. Arstotzka has recently opened its walls to let people inside the country, as long as their papers are all authentic. The game is basically a find the difference game that gets increasingly difficult as the game progresses as you need to check at more than only their passports, but many other documents. While the gameplay can become somewhat tedious, it works well into the setting and tone of the story as a job like this in real life wouldn't be all that exciting.   Along with the gameplay, a story comes to surface as you continue through the game. Without spoiling too much, it involves a terrorist organization. The story, while not unique, is well paced and really makes you want to play until the end to see the ending, which is easier said than done since there are a total of 20 different endings in the game. However, the best part of Papers Please comes in the form of multiple moral choices that you need to make throughout the campaign. They could be as small as deciding whether to reunite a couple, despite missing documents to something as big as letting in terrorist for some extra money. This is the beauty of this game as you can't always be a nice guy and help ever person who comes to you with a sob story. This also gives the game alot of replayablility as you can go back and see what the possible outcome may be if you make a different decision on that day. Overall, Papers Please may not be a game for everyone, but it is a well made game that deserves some praise and for only $9.99, it is worth every cent.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a simplistic masterpiece of straddling lines and juxtaposition.  Attacking the dark subject of oppressive, totalitarian/dictatorship governments isn't quite as depressing when done with broken English, cookie-cutter pixel-people, and hilarious immigrants. The impersonality of the character you play - a nameless border inspector - and his job - turning countless people away from the border - allows the player to make the character his/her own through imagination and the decisions made during the work-day. One playthrough you may be a mindless drone, dedicated to country and government, following every rule to the t. The next you could be a rebel, aligning with guerilla groups to thwart your evil government. Maybe you're an altruist, taking every opportunity you can to help the unfortunate people seeking to cross your border, even when it means your family may have to go without heat for a night. This is where the seeming impersonality of the game gives it another advantage; while you must remove yourself from many a situation when denying one entry to your country, while most of the game is based upon reducing people down to ID supplements and passports, accepting and denying as names and faces bleed together, you still have a family to take care of, and still make the occasional friend on the job, have an authentic connection with a person. And when most interaction is cold and impersonal, that occasional friendship means all the more. Deciding how to respond when a rebel group asks you to assassinate someone seems all the more important when the entire day was spent in a mindless tedium of passports and ID cards. Yet while you may not have expected it out of yourself, deciding to aid a drug smuggler when it will allow your wife and son to eat dinner that night suddenly becomes a very easy decision.  This is a casual game to slip into, but once you’re playing, it requires intense concentration, as you try to process as many people as possible in a given day while scrutinizing numerous pieces of paper for the tiniest discrepancy. It is a simple, mindless game on the surface, yet at its core challenges the player to consider human rights and the consequences of his/her decisions from personal to international scales.  I highly recommend this game. Among the multitude of indie titles available on steam, Papers Please provides a unique, rewarding experience sure to leave the player thinking.

239030,"Papers, Please","In Papers Please you are a customs official, responsible for approving or rejecting entry of immigrants. Gameplay involves checking documents for inconsistencies, like when a name or number doesnt match or documents are missing. There are also story specific rules like denying entry to all people from a specific country. Its surprisingly complex, but the game does a great job of gradually teaching the player new rules. You earn money for each approval, but have limited time per day, so have to be quick. But its also important to be accurate because you lose money for mistakes, and you have to earn enough to pay for rent, food and heat for your family. Sometimes you can earn extra money in bribes by bending rules, but there may also be unexpected consequences for your actions. Graphics and audio is basic, but don't let this put you off. Its a really great, unique game, only 5 hours long but there are multiple endings and there is some really funny dialogue. Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

It's a fairly simple concept, stamp passports with an increasingly complex set of rules to trip you up. Just when you think you've got the hang of it you'll fail to spot something else and get fined. The set of moral choices contrasting with that of duty and that of patriotism and politics are what make this game an interesting one that will keep you going until you've played all the endings.  The fact it saves every day means you can go back if you're not happy with a decision and try it again, and the save screen is clever in that it stores each branch you make if you want to try out different paths simultaneously.  All-in-all an enjoyable game, especially given the price, very good value.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is a great game with great characters who really portray the dystopian atmosphere. The government workers are cold-hearted, emotionless, only interested in your performance rather than your wellbeing. The entrants, such as Elisa, show you just how desperate things have become, yet your job as the Inspector prevents you from following your conscience and allowing them a new life in Arstotzka.   The music for bad endings is haunting and the music for good endings is uplifting.   It can get a tad boring after a while, but the progressively increasing difficulty helps you to stay on your toes and stay interested in the game.   Plus M. Vonel is an absolute beast",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers. Please is an indie game that puts you right into the seat of a border crossing with the power to approve or deny entry into your country. The country you work for is seemingly a dictatorship/communist country where the government has absoulute control of the population and you are assigned your job. The game starts out simple and you get different goals every level on who to let in or deny entry to from your government. It seems like a simple job to look at a passport and approve or deny it, but as the game progresses and based on how good or bad you do things change. Citizens must show id, foreigners must show other types of id, you begin to be allowed to search suspicious people for weapons. The game is quite fun and it ends up becomming very challenging to check so much information and so many different things. There is also a story behind the game when you are met with mysterious characters who are trying to tell you something. The graphics aren't great, but that just adds to the old communist type vibe. Overall I would highly recommend this game, especially at a low price. 8/10",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is in my opinion the best game of 2013 Looking at gameplay of it you may think it looks incredibly boring and tedious. It will seem like a reading simulator. This game has possibly the best moral choice system ever as instead of saying 'Good Ending' or 'Bad Ending' at the end of the game you form the ending and how your character is throughout the game. Every day you will have to decide whose life is more important than others. An example of this is when faced with somebody trying to get in with an expired passport to get surgery only available here. If you let this person through you will be faced with a penalty but save their life. You must choose whether to save them or keep your family warm and fed for the night.

I'll start off by saying that this is one of those 'one more turn' style games where it is very easy to lose track of time. You work as a checkpoint guard and it is your job to look at the paperwork of all people trying to enter and search for errors or forgeries. You can either allow them to enter or deny them. Meanwhile, you have a family at home that you must support and money is VERY tight. You get paid for every person that you correctly allow or deny entry to. However, if you are wrong, you won't get paid at all for that person. Not only that, but you have a time limit, so the pressure is on. This is the sort of game that will suck you in very quickly, especiall as you get better at the game.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a VERY DIFFERENT kind of video game. This is a game that constantly tests your observation skills. And also your speed to an extent. It's not really an exhilarating game, but it's an interesting game that can be quite enjoyable. The game has multiple endings and also has a good element of randomness to it. It starts off fairly easy and then progressively gets harder by adding more rules and requiring you to check more documents. Overall, I consider this to be a good game. This game is one of the best examples of how a video game can be VERY DIFFERENT from the norm, but yet can still be good if it's created well",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please",Great game. Never finished but didn't matter.  It's a bit heavy on the 'memorising facts' details- but perhaps that is one of the aspects that lends itself to a more complex game.

Music is very suitable. Going into this game 'cold' gives you alot of satisfaction. Recommended.,1,0

Not quite as great as when I bought Kerbal Space Program, but still very great.

239030,"Papers, Please","Fantastic Game. You have to keep both your wits and your morales around you in order to keep your family alive in communist Arstotka. At first glance this game makes you sort through passports and documents in order to keep frauds out of your country. You have to balance being thorough with speed though as work too slow and you may not be able to pay for your son's medicine but go too quickly and you might be fined for letting someone through who shouldn't be! Then, as the game progresses more and more moral dilemmas come to the fore (which i won't go into for the sake of spoilers). I'm normally only really into RTSs and Action games but i loved every second of this game.",1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","The only game I have ever seen that actually includes 'Moral Choices'. Not the kind in Mass Effect or the likes where you click a button and get a different ending where someone wears a slightly different hat or something, but as you play through the game you discover just how easier it is to slip into corruption when your family's lives are at stake.  It really is quite that simple. You work at the Border Checkpoint and have to check through people's paperwork as they try to get into the country, however many of them will try to use fake documents to sneak through. You have to pay attention to their birthdates, issuing country, expiry date and, letter on, things like there reason for coming to the country or quite simply their height. If you get one wrong, you get a beating from your boss and, if it happens too much, you start having your pay docked. Seeing as you get paid a measly amount, the fine you recieve can quite often be the difference between feeding your family, or watching them starve.  You soon realise how rare money is and how hard it is to come by, until eventually you find your own principles going out the window as you accept bribes just to stay alive. It comes to the point where you have a woman begging to come in to see her son, that she hasn't seen for six years, but you know that if you accept you lose the ability for pay for the heating in the middle of winter.  Papers, Please is, to me, just about a perfect game. It may not be the prettiest or the most complex, but it intigrates choice superbly into the game play and manages to get across a complex narrative without having to ramble on through cutscenes. You are always in control. You are the one rejected a woman who will be put to death if she returns to her country. You are the one who lets a serial killer through because you lose pay if you don't. The choices and the consequences are always in your hands.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Easily my favorite game of 2013.  Papers, please is a game that does something different than most games. Instead of giving you a gun and telling you to mow down hundreds of people, it gives you a passport and tells you to find discrepancies in it. Papers, please is a game that is addictive for casual play, but it is not meant to be played like a mobile game. This is a game with a focus on morality and choices. You are faced with letting certain people in and vice-versa, which is a surprisingly sad job. Families will get seperated in your checkpoint due to your actions. Criminals will get through. The government will arrest you.  There are 20 endings to this game, so the morality is very important.  If you are looking for an easy game, do not be purchase this game because of the cartoon artstyle or the simple gameplay. This is a game that you will remember for years to come.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please",Great game. Never finished but didn't matter.  It's a bit heavy on the 'memorising facts' details- but perhaps that is one of the aspects that lends itself to a more complex game.

239030,"Papers, Please","I have played this game, for about a million hours played the beta played another version of this. I have now bought it but not played much this was more so to support the developer and replay it as the other version was a bit broken.  POSITIVES 1. Easy Interface 2. Great replayability 3. Fun 4. Cheap Price  NEGATIVES  1. The game itself falls a bit short to around five hours to play everything but if you think about this like a movie in a cinema is around £7.00 Pounds in the UK for an hour or two this is six hours thats how I think of games my friend convinced me of this. 2. Can get boring at times, if you do not have the patience for indie games or like memory or consistently checking things and remembering this game might not be for you and might instead agitate you. 3. Replayability isn't as big as expected, it only involves around twenty endings involving you letting a person in or letting them out detaining them etc.   CONCLUSION  To conclude this off I would like to say its a great game with a few negatives such as the price is a little bit expensive. It has a very short story line of 4-5 hours, if your looking for a game with replayability Don't Starve and Faster Then Light are great examples of that. You should only buy this game if you like to support the developers and what they do, You might think OH Dear me this is one of them guys who tells you nothing if you should buy it or not. All am trying to say is click that Purchase button but try buying it while a sale is on I grabbed a copy for £3.50 which is pretty cheap.  8/10 'Buy it but be careful because the story line is short' +1 Has some great characters 'Jorji Costava' +1 Original idea the idea was never forged to do this. +1 Great user interface -1 The Price is quite expensive and should be made cheaper.

239030,"Papers, Please","I have always wondered what it would be like to live in a Class-8 Dwelling in a country that has just emerged from war and reopened its borders and I have been drawn out of a metaphorical hat to be in charge of its wellbeing. Oh? What's that! Papers,Please!  This game was a very, very interesing addition to my everygrowing list of games I should shake the hands of the developers of (Needs a catchier title)  It is a game where you play as an Immigration officer who is the only one in charge of the ENTIRE border control. Which means you have a workload, You have simply a Rule book, The news and a transcript and must make the important decision to accept or deny entry in to Arstotzka, You must carefully assess each bit of their passport, Entry tickets, Work permits, the rules change daily and to keep on top of them all is a difficult task indeed! For example on Day 1 You simply look for the passport and if all the details on that are up to scratch they are allowed in! If you get it wrong 3 times money begins to be deducted from your pay.  That last sentence influenced a lot in me, you have a family to care for who only living in a Class 8 dwelling will not survive long , you must get through enough people in a day to pay rent, Food and heat and sometimes your idiot Son goes and gets ill and you have to buy Medicine... That idiot! It toys with your emotions, you want to let this person in to see their Husband after they were separated after the war, but if you do you will directly be at blame and lose pay and possibly a Family member... See why I like this game alot!  Also the tension is insane! You have so much to think about in such little time it is hard not to become overhelmed and hide behind a convenient pringles can!   I highly recommend this game, the Tension it creates in currently unmatched and the fun you get out of it is addicting, It is also fairly cheap for what you get out of it! With exellence in its Music, Design and plot it is a massive contender for Game of 2013! Enjoy a Class 8 Dwelling folks!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is in my opinion the best game of 2013 Looking at gameplay of it you may think it looks incredibly boring and tedious. It will seem like a reading simulator. This game has possibly the best moral choice system ever as instead of saying 'Good Ending' or 'Bad Ending' at the end of the game you form the ending and how your character is throughout the game. Every day you will have to decide whose life is more important than others. An example of this is when faced with somebody trying to get in with an expired passport to get surgery only available here. If you let this person through you will be faced with a penalty but save their life. You must choose whether to save them or keep your family warm and fed for the night.

You have a family who relies on you to stay healthy, warm, and happy and they depend on your performance at the border crossing. At first it is very easy to determine whether or not someone should be admited (little things like expired passports or incorrect gender) but it quickly gets more complex as more paper work gets involved (things like work permits and diplomatic clearances).

You have to look over passports and as you progress through the game, more items will be added to check such as visas and stuff and you need to check every detail. It's a toss up at times between do your job and seporating couples, or allowing them through together as the authorities smack you for not doing your job as you have a family too and must make sure you are doing it right, otherwise you'll be unable to pay for food, heating or rent.

Roughly 4 hours of original gameplay experiences and replayability that depends on whether or not you enjoy any of those flash games.   That said, I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for it because it's one of those games that you'd expect to find on a flash website. It is dark and unique in its own bleak original way with good gameplay. The graphics are a definite boost to its atmosphere, not a negative, and my only gripe would be that the music only plays during the beginning and end of each game day, the music is just another little thing that really pulls you into it.",1,0

Or at least the option to change it. I also dont understand the point in asking the people about issues with their paperwork.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a very unusual but addictive game. Look at several documents, make sure the names, gender etc match up.

So, if you like the idea of being an inspector that just checks documents for discrepencies, buy this game. If you think the idea of playing border patrol sucks an egg, we all did before we played this game. However, any casual gamer with an eye for detail is likely to experience some fun with this. I could not reccomend this game to everyone, so I should add that if you need action, go elsewhere.

Gameplay is repetitive and dull. But despite this, the game shines because of excellent storytelling and a well crafted atmosphere. Some of the characters are barely animated but they manage to create strong feelings in the player; either of feer for your higher-ups, or of pity for the man who keeps trying to fake his passport.  My favorite memory of this game was my odd experience of winning it. I successfully 'escaped' the country by sacrificing my family. Most games would roll the credits, play some happy music and the player would feel closure. Instead, a song of mixed-feelings (upbeat yet sad) plays and I felt the power of the story, as well as the mixed-bag reality of life.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A surprisingly 'simple' game that is very good at what it tries to do: place you in the role of an overwhelmed, low-class worker in a dystopian society, fighting to get through the rules and regulations that each new day brings in order to feed their family.  As I said, the game is very simple at the heart of it. You check passports and answer the yes or no question of whether you allow someone into your country or not. But right away the game starts ramping up in difficulty. You have so many variables to check with a person's identity, their looks, birthdays and passport codes, cities and countries and insignias that need to match. And that's only within the first few days.  Pretty soon you are hit with immigration passes, work passes, forgeries and bribes, terrorists that can end your entire day's work if they're allowed through, among a number of other things. I'm only a third of the way through the days and I have so many things to keep track of, I'm swamped. And that's just what the game is going for.  Is this a game full of action and adventure? Not really. Is it full of exploration and excitement? Well, not really in the traditional sense. Is it worth playing? Certainly.  I didn't know what to expect from the beginning, and although the game is spent sitting in a window overlooking immigrants and civilians, frivolously examining passports and documents looking for faults, stamping acceptances and denials, it is still very interesting. I'm nowhere near done, but it does seem to be building towards something that I don't want to say, as it may give expectations away.  But go and play this game. Give it a chance.",1,0

There are so many potential stories in this game, you see so many people come by the checkout, and you are also confronted with whole states, but somehow the story stays small and personal too, in a way that replicates real politics.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Arstotzka so great, passport not required.' If only, Jorji, if only.  The demo for this game was so good it made me get a steam account just so I could play the full version. I get twinkly-eyed when talking about this game, and I talk about it to anyone who will listen. Such an aware and astute political comment. The game some how manages in that little cube checkpoint to be all about human relationships, and how compassion and revolution relate, and a million other themes. Even if you don't play compassionately, I think it's still true that it's about compassion. So there's a lot of heavy material, a lot that I still think about after months. But also it's funny and light? I think it goes back to the charm of relationships and interactions. There are so many potential stories in this game, you see so many people come by the checkout, and you are also confronted with whole states, but somehow the story stays small and personal too, in a way that replicates real politics. I could go on. Just play the game, you'll think a lot about states and morals and rebellion and empathy and power in the process.   That music too! wow!",1,0

You can do what you want, deny or approve a person (but no without penalties). And finally the emotional situations that you live inside it.

Papers, Please   is a beautiful little indie game by Lucas Pope, a gem that truly stands out in the ocean filled with Early Access Survival- and 8-bit 'retro' adventure games. The year is 1982, and you work as an inspector at a border security checkpoint. Dozens of people flow past each day, and you must carefully examine each person's passport and then either approve or deny their application. As days go, the game also gets progressively harder. Immigrants will be required to have more and more documents, and the payroll stays the same, yet you must also provide food and warmth for your family. Political backstabbing and tension between countries may also come into play, due to the 6-year-war between Arstotzka and Kolechia.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is one of the most innovative and bizarre games I think I've ever played. Working for your country's government as an immigration officer, you are tasked with checking people's credentials in order to make money to support your family. The graphics are similar to DOS games of the late 1980's which works great with the Soviet Russian theme of the game.  Every round is a day in the life of the border guard, and not only must you make split-second decisions you also have RPG elements that allow you to upgrade your booth's tools as well as interacting with your family, government and the people trying to enter your country. It's a great piece of political commentary on our own modern war against illegal immigration, terrorism, family values and Big Brother-type surveillance. You are lauded for processing people quickly and detaining potential threats and you are severely punished for not properly checking credentials, decorating your booth or failing to stop terrorists.  The game is linear, but worth several play throughs as the stories can change depending on your choices. The main drawback is the game is entirely based on click-and-drag which can become tedious. Personally, ive used a wacom tablet and found the game super addictive. I highly recommend this game to fans of the DOS era or anyone with communist sympathies! GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please",One of the best indie games in the world! You won't regret buying this game.,1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is probably one of my favourite games of all time. It does an incredible job of making a seemingly mundane task feel tense and engaging, and there were many occasions where the game challenged my morality.  You see, it's very difficult to be a good person in this game: sometimes youa re given scenarios in which you must deserve to a) let someone go through even if they're papers are not in order, thus decreasing the chances of your family receiving a good meal and medicine when sick or b) turn down someone who, for example, hasn't seen their son in years, and as a result feel like a sh*tty person.  The game is deceptively easy to begin with: simply let the Arstotzkans through and reject all foreigners. However, as the days go by, the number of factors that must be taken into consideration increases exponentially, and you find yourself frantically sifting between papers trying desperately to uncover potential errors and oftentimes having to go on a whim just so you can pay the bills at the end of the day.  That's not even considering the various subplots that occur around you. You could assist a revolution against the state, deliberately detain more people in order to earn a couple extra bucks. My favourite, and the most stressful, subplot is one where a guard working on the border asks you to let his girlfriend through, whose papers are inevitably incorrect. If you do help him with this, he thanks you, and all returns to normal. However, you now know exactly which guard he is on a day-to-day, and as a result you now feel responsible for keeping him alive. There are various instances of rebels attacking the broder and its guards, usually through bombing, and when it does happen, guards are always killed. Due to the frequency of these attacks, you are given a rifle and are instructed to neutralise the threat before it gets out of hand. However, now that you know which guard has family, which guard has a life outside of this monotonous, soul-crushing life, you then feel like his life is in your hands. This makes the game even more stress-inducing and engaging, and that, in turn, makes it even more brilliant.  This is a 10/10 experience and I would recommend it to everyone. Enjoy!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I wasn't prepared to like 'Papers, Please' from very early, early on when I read articles about this upcoming game I looked at it with confusion. It looked like the most boring game invented. I'm somewhat glad that it came in a recent Humble Bundle or I'd never have played it.  'Papers, Please' is an excellent little puzzler game masked beneath layers of interesting story and a rare bare interface. I won't give any of the story away, but what I will say is that this is a game that requires your full attention and that's great. It draws you in with simple enough gameplay but catches you out in places you'd never expect.  So if you like indie puzzle games this is definitely worth picking up.

However, sometimes it felt like a chore to me since you have to pay attention to little stupid details such as the height and weight of each person, the worst was to check if the issue city of the passport was correct. A friend joked that it's not a game but the data is to evaluate real people in Russia and the players are being used for free labor, wouldn't that be something?

239030,"Papers, Please","While I can see this game tries something interesting in letting you be an immigration inspector. Denying or accepting the people who wants to come in or through the country, it was a really horrible experience playing it, to the point where I won't finish it.  The good thing is that it tries something different, and the idea of deciding who gets in or out depending on their information is fun. However it is way too punishing, as you live the life of a guy, who suffers an existence worse than slavery. When you are a slave all you do is sleep, eat, and work. Here you get to work and sleep, but can't be sure if you get to eat. So a positive point, I guess, it makes it more understandable why free people in ancient Greece and Rome would sell themselves into slavery. -.- At least then they got to eat in exchange for the work they did.  'You must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.' I had expected that meant you got to decide, and that you would be judged based on what the people might do once in the country. But no. Accompanying you in the booth is an all knowing entity, that can instantly tell if you made a mistake. If the passport had an invalid issuing city, if the names didn't match, if it was expired, if the picture was wrong. Making your existence pointless. If they are able to instantly tell if I denied or accepted the wrong person, why the ♥♥♥♥ have an immigration inspector? Clearly the automated system works perfectly. I refuse to believe that in a low technologically advanced country, that they would be able to instantly know every mistake every single inspector makes. And because of this all knowing system, it doesn't become about choosing who to let in or out, since you get fined every time you don't follow protocol to the letter, or make a mistake. (Again if they can see every single slip up, what is the point of the job? It is not just a crap job, it is an utterly pointless one.) It becomes about working as fast as possible to check the information, opening up stupid info, and since you get paid based on the number of people you process you often have to gamble if looking something up simply takes too long with the small space you have to work with.  I do think this game could be enjoyable, if the difficulty could be turned down a bit. So all the information you had to sort through could be on the screen at once, and you didn't have to look up or remember the things that were in the rule book about the different countries all the time, or if the time each day was longer, so you could get more people through.

239030,"Papers, Please","I bought this game with somewhat high expectations in the Dec 2014 Holiday Sale recently. It's been well-received, won numerous awards and what-not...so I thought let's give this a go.  Overall though, I must say I am disappointed with my purchase. Papers, Please is ultimately a 'spot the difference' kind of game. You are an immigration official at the border. Your job is to compare pieces of info to find discrepancies, and if none are found let people through, and conversely, if any discrepancy is found, deny people entry into your state.   I must heartily admit that while this premise sounds simple, it is actually very addicting. Gradually, things become more difficult and complex, and the length of the days increase. New rules are added, and they keep changing from day to day.  However, ultimately the undoing I feel is the fact that this game is not random in nature. The progression is always the same. The special events are always the same. So while this game is made to be replayed, by the third playthrough, it's all boring.   There are multiple endings, but many are similar actually. There are three 'main' endings upon which you can be considered to have won the game.   The narrative feels lacking as well. Graphics are incredibly limited. And the sound is really irritating.   All things considered, this is nowhere near as great a game it is claimed to be. At least, that's how I feel. It's interesting and addicting for a while, that's for sure. You can probably get two playthroughs in before any kind of repetition sets in. I'm not entirely happy buying it, but I feel I did have some fun playing it and to not recommend it would be unfair. I say, buy this at a steep discount cause the mileage is limited.",1,0

My first foray into video games was an IBM 286 with 512k of RAM, so the one thing I do appreciate about this game is its graphics, which were obviously inspired by mid-late 80s PC gaming. The fonts and character portraits are top notch.  There is also a great irony to this game, that perhaps the maker intended, and that is: Without the types of people who derive joy and satisfaction from the tasks that must be undergone in this game, the type of cold totalitarian regime portrayed in this game would never be possible in the first place.

The humour is fairly good, the atmosphere/retro thing is fine/good too, so is the interaction with the equipment/limited desk space - I also like that the creator of this game has got great reviews and sold a lot of copies because it is innovative and encourages/persuades people to try new themes without being horrendously intimidated by big budget, but in the end, I'm bored of this after 4 hours.",-1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game proved to be more tedious than fun. As an immigration Inspector, the premise of the game is to check prospective emigrants' paperwork for defects and inconsistencies. As the game goes on, you are charged with enforcing ever-more complicated rules. The chief problem is that the entire game is done under extreme time pressure--you have a set amount of time each 'game day' to process as many applications as possible.  You earn money when you correctly process an application, and get penalized when you incorrectly admit or deny someone. At the end of each game day, you must pay a set of expenses to keep your family alive and healthy (ex., rent, food, heat, etc.). If you ever run out of money, you automatically lose the game. But as the game goes on and the rules you must enforce become more and more complex, the game grows ever more tedious. Trying to process as many applications as I could without making mistakes, without wasting undue time, etc., made Papers, Please more stressful than fun to play.

Game doesn't seem to change much. The things you have to check get more complex, but the setting and rewards don't. The family management is pretty lame, all you do is check boxes and struggle to keep people that you don't even actually see alive and well. It appears more mechanics are introduced from the screens on the store page but the game is so tedious it really doesn't incentivise you to stay with it long enough to enjoy them. I'm glad i only paid a few bucks during a sale, however at this point in time I really don't think it was even worth it.

239030,"Papers, Please","Decent enough game, but loses it's charm by Day 16. This is due to the game being over complicated by this time, and having quite a few coding/recognition bugs. The Devs didn't seem to realize that most human can only keep up to 7 things in working memory at any given time, and going over that means rolling the dice and hoping you got your decision right. This abuse of short term memory leads to irritating headaches.  The game puts time constraints on you to process as many immigrants as possible, but penalizes you for incorrectly dealing with them (no pay, more than two screw ups leads to increasing fines). This is fine, but made worse by having to remember a boat load of information. Trying to get information out of the UI is a pain, because of how ugly, cramped and buggy things get.   Like other reviewers have stated, this game stops being fun and instead becomes a chore to get through, thanks to a clunky UI and cramped documents screen. The artifical difficulty early on; no hot keys or tabs for specific pages in your log book, serves to frustrate the player even more, and even when you get the option to use these features, they're still clunky and awkward to use. Replayability is non-existent, given how tedious the gameplay can get. Twenty endings is nice and all, but if your game is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to operate, then don't expect me to stick around and experience them all, when a simple LP on youtube could suffice.  Wait until it goes on sale: If this were the olden days of video store rentals, I'd say rent it and exchange if you don't enjoy it. But those days are gone, and purchases are permanent past two hours. When the game only last six hours, and you could get a game rental for $10 a week back in the day, you realize that $10 dollars for Papers Please is too much.",-1,1

The problem for me is quite simple, even if you are good at spotting errors, and adapting to new variables; the gameplay is too rough to allow for anything other than precise execution.  Basically, it is clumsy as mess to move papers around, to stamp things, and the way time flows is often difficult to predict and pin down. While in theory this should create even more tension, it often feels like I am failing not because of my abilities, but the game's ability to communicate my actions.

239030,"Papers, Please","3 / 5  Such a hard game to review...on one hand it can be strangely fun, but on the other hand many aspects come across so poorly you wonder if they were conscience design choices and even if they were, WTF!?  Playing as a border crossing guard, you are given money for the number of people that are permitted to into the country and docked pay for those you allow in that should be turned away. At the end of the day you go home to your family who slowly freezes, starves, and gets ill as the game progresses. The intent is, do your job well enough and you can keep your family (mostly) alive and eventually move them out of the country. Don't, and you fail in a variety of different ways.  Possessing extremely simple graphics, sound, FX, and story means this game must stand heavily on gameplay elements. To that end, 'Papers, Please' revolves around its simple 'point and click' interface, forcing the player to review stacks of constantly changing 'papers' to determine whether the person trying to gain admittance to your border crossing booth is permitted entry or not. If this sounds boring, it isn't...at least at first. For the first 30 minutes or so the game is a fun 'spot the thing that doesn't belong game' with a few characters that liven up the experience (the guy trying to come into the country with a hand drawn passport was priceless).  The problem comes as they ramp up the difficulty. Rules for admittance change on a daily basis in response to regional activities and new control schemes are introduced along with them. It starts by first introducing new documents to look over and quickly gets into full body searches, interrogations, etc. However, many of these new mechanics are barely mentioned and even less so demonstrated. On one hand (speaking as a person whose worked in bureaucratic agencies for too long now) this accurately portrays how most top level directives are given and thus realistically uses gameplay to mimic real life...on the other hand its frustrating as hell. And just when you start to think you get a handle on the new items to look for they throw in a random thing like person gender being wrong, expiration date, etc that make you feel like an absolute moron for not catching the mistake. And mistakes you will make...and be caught for every single violation. This does create a palpable sense of anger at 'the man' and feelings of hopelessness as you and your family suffer the results of your ineptitude, but in the end made me wonder if they can always catch my screw ups, why can't they just screen the border themselves?!  In the end, the game has an interesting premise and does well in conveying some aspects of life, but I have to seriously question if I consider this 'fun'. To those looking for and/or good at 'spotting the thing that is wrong' this game is definately for you. Otherwise, I'd say pass.",-1,1

This game IS about fail. The rules change every 5 minutes and the game is designed in such a way that you cannot follow them all, so the fail is imminent, you just get to see if you failed sooner or later. Probably sooner.

You could call it job simulator, with the exception of there being an actual story and interesting interactions and decisions to make that could impact the entire in-game country, pretty uncharacteristic of a boring day job. That said, there are plenty of other games that offer a good story without boring drudgery.  The difficult part about critiquing this game, just like The Stanley Parable is their advantageous position as 'art' games. If I say the game was too boring, some would reply with 'that's the point'. If I say this game wasn't boring and realistic enough, what with the conspiracy plots and all, another person would say 'well its a game, what do you expect? It still has to appeal in some way'. This effectively makes it impossible to criticize the game, as any good aspects people remember and tout all the time, while the bad aspects people will attribute to it being just 'part of the experience'.

It is so freaking stressful and bleak that I don't really even want to play it anymore, even though the game itself is well-created, interesting, and has good mechanics. In the first three in-game days, I became an agent of an oppressive regime, my son got sick, my family got cold and hungry because I wasn't getting paid well, I accidentally let a terrorist get by me and blow up several people, and I had to send someone to their death because of bureaucratic rules -- it was ether that or not be able to afford to buy medicine for my sick son. It didn't matter, though, because by day 3 I had racked up too many citations and was sent to prison, game over. It's one thing to play a game where you are responsible for your own impending death, quite another to play a game where you are forced to be responsible for others' deaths.

239030,"Papers, Please","Edit: I've just discovered that there is an 'easy mode' you can activate in the options menu. I will update this review after I play some more. This might change my recommendation.   I've got to say. I like games with a unique, even story telling type, style. That being said, I don't like this game. Not because it is a bad quality game. But, I didn't find it fun. This game puts you in charge of a border control station. All that stands between a terrorist attack and safety, is you. As you progress, the game get's harder, giving you more and more information to check in order to carry out your duty. Did i mention this is a husband simulator as well? No? Because you have to get through as many people as possible in the time limit in order to get payed enough to feed, heat, and care for your family. Oh, and also pay rent. This is where my enjoyment ends. I like the idea of picking what necessities are, well, important right now for your family. Skipping out on food to pay for medicine, or heat. But, I am terrible at this game. I can't slow down and enjoy the atmosphere, or the writing, because i'm too busy trying to speed through this 'Job.' both aspects are unique, both are clever, but put them together and it kills both parts of the game. I might give this game another shot. I've learned and grew my skill, but this game plays like a proof reader job. And focusing on just gameplay, it's a little boring. The writing would definitely pick things up, but I can't enjoy the writing because of the 'come on, move it' nature of the gameplay. Maybe adding an easier mode would change this. I know some people will enjoy this game. Many already have. But, it's not for me.",-1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I really truly don't understand all the excitement over this game. It must be some sort hip indie game thing.  This game is frustrating, obnoxious, confusing and not at all interesting. You are expected to (literally about 5 minutes in) memorize several gibberish names of cities for each of a bunch of countries. Then it tests that by changing only one letter in the name (a 'c' to a 'k' for example), so you need to memorize the spelling as well. You COULD check the map in the rule book but this takes forever and your family dies due to you not making enough money per day. At the same time, you are to check a myriad of other things for validity, many of which are never made clear to the player. It never told me I had to check ID number for validity and I still don't know what makes an ID number valid or not. I had to google how to tell a man that he needed a passport as this wasn't adequately explained either and the game refused to progress until I dealt with it.  On top of this, you need to make sure the passport photo matches, which is a complete crapshoot considering the character portraits lack any detail. Usually at least once a (in-game) day the game tells me I was wrong just because I don't know what constitutes a good enough match.  And this is all just a few levels in. Supposedly it gets considerably more tedious and confusing. Becuase that's somehow an enjoyable game mechanic? You actually have to UNLOCK hotkeys from the storyline. What.  On the plus side the music is pretty great.   I'd never recommend it, but apparently I'm the wrong one and everybody simply loves processing paperwork according to confusing, obnoxious, unexplained beaurocratic rules. I simply did not enjoy it.

Papers, Please is a very interesting game, and I can certainly see why it is so popular and well rated, but for me it felt like sifting through pages to find one small error. Once you get to the stage where forgeries are possible, there are all kinds of stuff you have to watch out for; incorrect copies of a variety of symbols, incorrect cities f4rom various countries, and so on. It's not so bad at first, but having to do this faster and faster to save your starving family, it gets very annoying to have to flick through several pages to check symbols and city names.  This is a good game, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't my style. I found it too repetitive, and very hard to come to grips with in the first few rounds - my family died in three days because I couldn't process fast enough, didn't know what to look for.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is probably the most underwelming thing i've ever purchased, and that includes some incomplete and unplayable early access games. Papers, Please was so completely outside of my comprehension that I had to write my first review about it just to get closure.  The gameplay consists of looking at a picture and making sure all the numbers &amp; letters on it match up to some other numbers &amp; letters distributed around your screen and filed away in leaflets that you must flip through to find the correct page. Essentialy this is the worlds least interesting and most frustrating 'spot the difference' game. It is tedius, cumbersome, and unengaging. Which is what I expected, to a degree.  My ability to track every detail of small grainy images is apparently lackin,g because after the first game day it took me a minumum of 2 minutes per passport to comb for all the minutia, and I still had a failure rate of 1/3. Once it cited me for an incorrect photograph, and I honestly had not noticed a discrepancy between the two pictures despite comparing the two; I had thought they were similar enough having the same face, hair, and beard, but apparently not. I played half an hour before I could bear no more, my levels of irritating and impatience. It was over a year before I gave it another try, inspired by all the praise I had read. My experience was no better than the first, and I cannot see myself trying again ever.  When I began I cut off all food and heat expenses, since the game offered no incentive to keep them on. Processing the amount of documents necessary to maintain those expenses is beyond my capabilities, so letting my 'family' die would be the optimal choice from a gamey perspective. From a story perspective, if you can call it that, the game gave me no reason to care about them: just letters on a form, after all. They didn't even have names.  The game punished me for my apathy when the game suddenly ended on the forth day. Apparently the family dying causes instant loss. Since I am not capable of playing the game quickly enough to pay for their expenses, this is as far as I progressed and as far as I coupld ever potentialy progress in this game.  But that is the gameplay. As I understand it the real reason this game gets praise is for its story, art and atmosphere, apparently. After playing the game, I am legitamately questioning whether all this praise is some kind of elaborate joke, as far fetched as that sounds: the coordination required would be astounding.  The story in full as I experienced it is, you are a man who checks immigrant's paperwork. You have 4 family members. the job gets harder every day. I kept waiting for some kind of twist or element that would explain the hype, suddenly make it engaging, or at the very least make me feel someing, or care even slightly, but in never came. If it comes later in the game, I am both unwilling and incapable of reaching that point.   Occasionaly the immigrants say things or beg to be let in, etc. but seeing as there is no apparent gameplay benefit or narrative pay-off to be had basing your decisions on anything but whether or not you earn a citation, I quickly tuned them out.   As for the atmosphere and art, there are some grey pixels, some black pixels, and I think even some white pixels. The intro and failure screen has red and orange pixels. There may have been some blue pixels but I cannot confirm or deny this.   So as should be clear at this point, did not enjoy this game. The gameplay is unbearable but I could have forgiven this if there was at least something outside of the gameplay to experience. I personally play games more for their story, characters, narrative and world anyway, but there are almost none of those things in Papers, Please, and I am given no reason to care about what little there is.   Above all I am left confused. If all the things that the game is praised for barely exist, and the other elements are addmitted to be terrible even by the fans, where does the praise come from? I found no redeeming qualites in this game whatsover and am completely baffled that most players did. What am I missing? What have I overlooked that explains why people liked this? I am genuinely baffled.",-1,1

Depending on how much you believe someone's story or if you are pleased with their offer of a bribe, you may choose to let through someone you aren't supposed to. Admit someone you shouldn't or deny access to someone who deserves it and you get nastygrams from your boss that shift into fines. There's also a plot to mess up the government you can assist or ruin and as many as twenty different ways to end the game.  There's just one problem: it gets boring. It actually reminded me quite a lot of a job reviewing documents that I quit because ... boring. The difficulty here is largely in your attention span to minute details - after a while, even when you know what all to to look for, your attention will drop off and you will make mistakes and start racking up nastygrams.   If you enjoy studying numerous documents for any appearance of a contradiction, forget playing this game - get a job as a policy services analyst for an insurance company and get paid to do it instead of just doing it here for pretend.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please or Red Tape of a Red State  I enjoyed this game and I certainly got my money's worth. It is executed brilliantly and the music, sound, scripted events and design are great. The bleak tone of a red state is presented well and should appeal to a child of the 80s who remembers the closing decade of the Cold War.  However most gamers in general may not enjoy the relentless bureaucracy; let me explain. Each in-game 'day' normally lasts 12 hours (about 10 real minutes) and your income depends on how many entrants you process (too many mistakes penalizes your income). In theory this is a good risk/reward balance and keeps things moving. In practice it gets pretty grueling.   If you don't have an eye and attention span for detail this game won't be very appealing. If you've ever worked a desk job it will feel very much like real-life work. On my second playthrough (achievement hunting) I actually found myself checking the in-game clock to see if my shift was almost over. That's when I realized I couldn't give this game a thumbs up to the general public in good conscious.  Lastly I do recommend this game to achievement hunters. It's not difficult, extremely inexpensive on sale and easy enough to get to 100% in &lt;10 hours.  Glory to Arstotzka, glory to relentless bureaucracy!",-1,1

239030,"Papers, Please","This is one of those games that I both love and hate at the same time. They capture the mood of Cold War-era paranoia and bureaucratic insanity perfectly, and most times it's relatively funny what new nonsense they come up with for me to check. The problem I have is I just don't find it fun. Obviously this sort of thing is subjective, so I'll give my reasons why I don't enjoy this game. The biggest thing is it doesn't feel like a game. It feels like a job. I'm put under the same nerve-wracking stress I feel when I'm doing something for payment. Am I going to miss one tiny little detail and be thrown yet another violation message? Will another bomber get through and, as a result, the AGB will kick down my apartment door and gun down my entire family? Am I breathing correctly, or does my posture sitting at this border crossing booth suggest I'm a traitor?  The whole thing feels like I'm at a job. I didn't pay 10 dollars to do a job. I paid ten dollars to have fun. I know the whole point of the game is to put you under stress and make you scrutinize the tiniest details of 1,000 rules and subrules that just keep on piling up while your whole family starves and dies, but that just isn't my idea of fun. It'd be like if I bought a game where I had to answer the telephone and worry about accidentally letting a telemarketer through to my manager. It'd be like playing a game where I'm a janitor and if I miss cleaning the floor somewhere I'm reprimanded, but if I clean it and someone slips I'm reprimanded, etc.  Stress is a part of any decent slightly challenging video game. I understand that. This is work stress, though. This is something I play games to try to escape. I don't want more of it when I'm actually playing a game and not doing menial labor for menial payment. I feel like the developers should be paying /me/ for every hour I'm playing Papers, Please. All in all, it's certainly not a bad game. It's certainly not the worst game. You might even enjoy it. This is about whether I recommend it or not, though. If you want to feel like you're at a job without the payment part, or really, REALLY like Cold War history/satire, pick it up. If you don't, buy 10 dollars worth of pancakes or something.",-1,0

Maybe that is supposed to be part of the challenge, but clicking and dragging and flipping through the rulebook frantically looking for that thing I know is wrong so that I can highlight it to begin the process of detaining, asking for papers, etc. takes much of that fun out for me.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers please has some major flaws but also a few positives. Lets start with the positives: It makes every single statistic into a individual. by this i mean each person u decide to allow into the country (or deny depending on your choice) has there own individual story, these seemingly pointless people are individuals. This is the main selling point for the game and i can see why people like it so much.  Another good point is the way youre thrown into this game its quite immersive, u have to slave for hours over a desk deciding peoples fates. However (now for the bad parts) with this immersion it essentially just what it would be like irl, u slave over a desk clicking accept or deny and for me that can be a bit boring. Yes u hear peoples stories but at the end of the day it doesnt effect me or phase me in the slightest. I really couldnt give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' is a stressful rage-inducing work. As far as I've played, I haven't felt any sense of accomplishement, only increasing stress as each day is painfully spent racing against the clock to have enough persons going through to meet the necessary quota while making sure not to let unauthorized persons in... Or authorized out. On top of that, I find the voices' SFX absolutely ear-grating - but of course that will probably differ from person to person. The game itself runs smoothly, and has no major bugs... Or if it does, it'll make you think it's your fault for missing a discrepancy on a passport...

239030,"Papers, Please","First and foremost, this game has a little something called 'atmosphere' going for it. Everything about the aesthetic, the music, and even the gameplay is carefully crafted to achieve a certain feeling to the game's world, and if that's all you want from a game, then great, pick this up.  However, the gameplay quickly becomes Paper Pusher Simulation 3000, with new gameplay features being little more than another checkbox on your list of tasks. Again, this helps contribute to the game's world brilliantly. However, a couple of things ruin the sense of immersion the game is going for almost as badly as the infamous Conversation Wheel did for Oblivion:  1) Slowing down to appreciate the game's world and feeling are punished. You only receive much-needed money for each case you complete, and each day introduces its own timer. Feel like slowing down and examining each person in the checkpoint throughly, perhaps understanding a bit more of their history or any quandries they may face from being rightfully denied? Want to take time to think over moral choices? OOPS, TOO BAD, YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR FOOD. WORK HARDER, SLAVE.  2) You, the player, are meant to be a border inspector, ensuring that no criminals or undesirables enter the country through illegal means. To ensure quality, the player is warned and then fined for mistakes. However, this raises an irritating question: if your employers can instantly detect that the person you waved through has fake papers, why in the name of Odin are they paying you?  However, I will admit that the gameplay is deeply intuitive, and I appreciate that there's no hand-holding tutorial. However, at the end of the day, what I come to a video game for is gameplay. And when the gameplay amounts to cross-referencing data and double-checking statements with few results that the player can see beyond the pocketbook? It grows staler than a 'Hammer Time' joke.

239030,"Papers, Please","I was very intrigued by the concept of the game, seeing as I had never played anything even remotely comparable before. Papers, please truly is a unique experience - alas - not an enjoyable one for me.  The biggest problem I had with this game was the core gameplay, the paper checking. As you progress, the game grows more complex as it challenges you to review more and more information in the same amount of time. You'll be granted new ways to check up on and process people, and sometimes characters will slip you unexpected offers/bribes/etc. with their passports. However, most of what you do is just that: checking papers for matching data. That is not fun. It's... paperwork.  While for other people, this activity might take a backseat to the other facets of the game, I couldn't bring myself to sit through this bland, monotonous grind just to experience what else the game might have to offer. If you've ever had to work a really boring job and felt like it was the wrong decision to take it in the first place, you should know what I'm talking about. Maybe the creators of the game wanted you to feel bored and disengaged. Perhaps they wanted to use the game as a medium to recreate this feeling of working a horrible job. If they did: kudos, mission accomplished. But I can't help but feel like this may have worked better as a choose-your-own-adventure book, where you would have gotten to the story bits faster and wouldn't have had to drown yourself in repetitiveness in-between these parts. The game managed to make me quit because it was too boring. That can hardly be its intention.  Something else that bothered me is the visual style of the game. Although I consider myself a fan of pixelated graphics, I feel like Papers, please could have profited from more detailed character models. If the face of the people whose life depends on you is almost expressionless, you will have a hard time mustering up the empathy needed to feel anything toward these characters - no matter what happens to them. The often monosyllabic dialogue or the mumbling voices don't really alleviate this problem. Even if the creator's plan was to create an impersonal, dystopian setting, the human interactions at least should feel a bit more personal. Otherwise it'll just keep people from immersing themselves in the game.  I did not complete any of the game's branching paths. So naturally my review can cover only parts of the game. Although there seemed to be interesting stuff going on story-wise... after the eighth (in-game) day of stamping papers I just didn't want to anymore. I recommend this only if you do not mind enduring depressingly dull gameplay for the sake of narrative.",-1,0

You do your best to see if people have the correct credentials, but it will always give you a citation if you miss something - like there is someone watching over your shoulder who already knows whether they do or not.

239030,"Papers, Please","Grade: C/B-  Summary Review: Good- An creative idea for a video game with definite potential; unique design Bad- Awkward UI, An unfulling experience  Description: You play as an immigration inspector at a border checkpoint for the country of Arstotzka. Your job is to deny or accept people's request to enter the country based off their paperwork. Failure to deny access to those with false paperwork (such as terrorist, criminals or just those with legitamite reasons) will cause a loss of pay which will have significant impact on the wellbeing of yourself and your family.   Review:  Um I don't exactly know what to say about Papars, Please. After playing for one run through and about 1 hour and a half I don't really think this is a good game. There is certainly potential in this game. While simple it was engaging to play border security- it was almost like a detective sitting at the desk. Not to mention it offers a unique perspective on the effects of authoritarian regimes (like the USSR) on average everyday people. But there are to many issues for this to be a good experience. For one the way you examine paperwork is unwieldy and given that your on the clock (you have til 6:00 til your shift is over) time wasted going back and forth between ever increasing pieces of paperwork becomes iritating and impossible to see errors or mismatching information. I understand that this is an attempt to simulate reality but this doesn't really bring anything to a videogame's experience. Literally this games need 'Less Papers, Please'. I will perhaps give Papers, Please further attempts but I don't see myself getting anything more out of this game.",-1,0

If you love challenging puzzle games, that have an outstanding degree of choices and outcomes from your actions, then this is that game for you. But While the start of the game is fun as it prgresses the novelty of it wears off.   While it has dozens of hours of replay value, when it's at the point in it's progressing. It's just no longer satisfying. In which there are so many things to go wrong to get penalized on, and that at that point it's easier just to pick people at random (without inspecting anything) just let them through regardless. And now with playing a few hours of it, I'm starting to regret my purchase, and that I have wasted my money on a game I'll only play once.",-1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","In this game, you play as an Immigration Control Officer of a fictional dystopian country. This means you will be doing tedious stuff like ensuring that the passport and other documents have not expired, that a potential immigrant's work permit passport number matches with his presented passport, that the picture on the passport actually matches the person and other trivialities. You do not have the luxury to peruse the papers at your leisure because you have a limited amount of time each day to process immigrants - your daily pay is based on how many people you accurately serve.   If you want to be good at this game, it will demand that you memorize the *geography* of this fictional world, like which cities belong in the country of Republia, and which districts are in your home country of Arstotzkan. So if you enjoy filling your head with completely useless trivia, then go for it! I'd personally spend that time learning real world geography if my inclinations ever took me in that direction (although for censorship/political reasons, the game creators wisely refrained from adding any Real World countries).  The game is a monotonous drone of menial work. Playing it felt like work to me. Story mode offers occasional flashes of excitement when you are asked to perform some 'cloak &amp; dagger' operations or resolve some moral dillemma, but this happens around 10% of the game and is not enough reward to chore the rest. The developers could have chosen to add a lot more 'custom events' to make the game more engaging, but I guess it was not done due to time/budget constraints, laziness, or possibly a desire to achieve realism. I guess a border official's life is pretty boring - in game you meet a former border official and he tells you something to the tune of 'I'm glad I'm no longer in that business'.  In a nutshell: This game is work. If you want work that badly, then go get a job instead of playing this game.",-1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is a waste of your time and your money. They should have sold this as a training simulator for the TSA / border patrol.  Really bad gaphics that try to be 'indie/edgy' but just come across as cheap and lazy, especially when some of the gameplay hinges on your ability to determine details that you can't see because of the low graphics.  The 'story' is non existent, it takes an incredibly long time to 'progress' if it can be called that, it's REALLY slow, uninteresting, and not engaging AT ALL.  The gameplay is literally the most boring thing I have ever experienced in my life. You will literally have to check every line of info on the various documents that are presented to you against a 'rule book', to make sure that everything is correct will take anywhere from 1-3 minutes, and you have about 10 minutes in a 'day'. If you don't process at least 15-20 people in a day, there is no way you can possibly 'survive' much less 'win' the story.  This game is a failure on every front.   Graphics: 4/10  Sound Design: 3/10 (same sounds, music repeated ad nauseam)  Story: 2/10  Gameplay 1/10  This is the classic example of an indie game getting praise from people for being 'edgy' or 'different'.

239030,"Papers, Please","Have you ever been stuck in line at customs, waiting with passport in hand to visit or return to the United States and watched as a uniformed TSA agent peers intently at your passport deciding if you get to enter or not? Did you ever think, ‘By golly! Somebody should make a video game about this!’ No? Neither have I, but Indy game maker, Lucas Pope has in his “dystopian document thriller,” Papers, Please available on Steam for $9.99.  In Papers, Please you have been selected by the clearly communist government of East Germany – I mean Arstotzka to be a border checkpoint inspector at the recently opened border crossing between there and some made other made up country. Seeing as how vital this job is to the national security of Arstotzka you are given a detailed training course and after a long six weeks of shadowing an expert border crossing agent you are finally on your own to prove yourself after learning all the tricks of the pros! Ha ha, just kidding. You are given a tiny handbook, a weird stamping gizmo, and off you go!  So you walk to work and start checking passports! How thrilling is that? Actually it’s not, it’s incredibly tedious as the game is overly complex. There are a million different reasons to deny entry and each day your job gets more and more complex as government edicts make your life a living hell. There are not just the obvious things either that could be wrong on the passports, sure there’s the obvious of the picture not matching or the wrong sex, or the id number on the passport doesn’t match the id number on a travel permit. But then really nitpicky things like the issuing city doesn’t match, since all the nations and city names are fictional, something you’d only know by flipping through your rule book for each and every passport.  So you spend usually a minute or two scouring and comparing all the papers. When you find a discrepancy you are supposed to interrogate the person. You do this by selecting the comparison icon in the bottom right corner and select the two mismatching items. If the name on the work permit doesn’t match the passport, click on both and then interrogate the person. You can even have them detained by your guards if you feel it necessary. But this system is incredibly clunky if someone does not present proper documents or the city does not match as you have to flip through your rule book and select the broken rule. Now that you’ve handled that person in line, time to do it all over again! If this all sounds like a lot of work, that is because it is! After eeking my way through the first couple days in game I felt like I had just paid $10 to work a second job and even a particularly exciting one!  Underneath all this work there are a few story lines which I guess are kinda interesting in the way you get weird customers at a boring retail job can spice up your day. But the payoff is just not worth the work required to get through the game. I think somebody forgot to tell the maker of Papers, Please that we PLAY games, not work at games. Just because a game is incredibly complex and intricate does not make it fun and actually can make it far far too tedious, cumbersome, and ultimately dull.  While it can be kinda satisfying to detain some idiot for trying to pass through your checkpoint with phony papers or even approve a lady entry who’s running for her life but doesn’t have all her required documents the game still drags. Work. Work. Work. Work. And eventually I’m sick of it. I want to give at least a kudos to the developer for trying a new idea of intertwining a story into a mundane every day experience but there is far too much work to get there. Even worse it feels like my job is pointless as somebody must be watching everything I do. Each time I make a mistake a computer printout reprimands me and after more than two mistakes each day starts hitting me with fines. Get too many fines and you can’t afford your rent and you’re fired and arrested for delinquency. Lovely.  Each day add up your pennies, pay rent, and then go broke. Just like real life! Apparently you are paid $5 per person who passes through your booth as long as you get them through before closing time. However good luck affording luxuries like heat or medicine when your family is sick, especially if you are hit with even one or two penalties during your work day.  In the end, I’d probably pass on Papers, Please even if it was half the price. Unless you are really into comparing documents or you ever really really wanted to be a TSA agent. Papers, Please is too much work and not enough actual fun for me.

239030,"Papers, Please","★ out of four.  I imagine Papers, Please was constructed around its main action of processing in-game paperwork at a border crossing. Papers, Please doesn't actually have any commentary to make. Validating the paperwork itself is the strongest part here, as you try to do your best in the timed work day. Indeed, more rules are added over time and it is up to each player to physically organize their desk and the placement of documents, but also to mentally process how to approach things. What is the best order (for you?) to check information? Is there enough time during a suspect's body search to do anything useful? The binary choices you make on a personal level are just interesting enough to entice replaying them. Yet, these choices have little payoff, which is true of Papers, Please overall.",-1,0

Because you only get paid for people that enter, you want to let as many people in as possible. Which brings the next problem...  Time based You only have limited time. Meaning if you get a difficult case, you automatically get less income. It's counterproductive. It's also unfair, but I guess that's how the regime works.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Observation Skills: The Game.' I find this game pretty interesting. You play as a documents inspector working at a border checkpoint. Oh yeah, this is a checkpoint that leads into a corrupt, dystopian, and fascist nation.  The game goes out of its way every so often to test your sense of right and wrong. Will you let a woman who lacks documentation but is in need of an experimental surgery that is only available in your country past the checkpoint? Or will you deny her entry in order to retain the job you need to provide for your family?  Gameplay is pretty much just examining people's passports, permits, work passes, etc. and then issuing a stamp of denial or entry. Curveballs get thrown at you though which mix up the variables that ultimately decide whether a person can pass or not. And with about twenty endings, the game knows how to keep you engaged.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a strange game to recommend.  It's not a bad game, far from it, but the game is rather special. Much like Cart Life or Cooking Mama the game has you doing relatively simple and mundane actions for almost no reward.  Unlike Cooking Mama though, there's a huge story at work here one, which you as an inspector at a border checkpoint, get to experience first hand.  You will meet several characters, see the arcs they go through, reunite families and desperately try to care for your own, because the glory in Arstotzka is gone, but time races ever forward and you have to meet the standards set by the government or your job, family and freedom will be taken from you.  If you want something different, interesting and thought-provoking then get Paper's, Please.",1,0

Is one of the things you'd be saying the most, you take role as a person who is the only one to tell if someone is allowed into the country of Arstotzka.After 6 horrible years the borders now finally open, but beware. Fake Id, fake passes, and fake asses. It is your job to approve, or deny peoples entrance, and if someone seems dangerous for the country you got the option to detain him.  This game was hard for me to pick up, due to its somewhat 'stale' looks, but i am more than impressed for how adictive this is. It has humor, tension and action in it. Its definetly worth a try!

Instead, you will be required to really focus and try to do your thing the best possible way you can. Even though you might think that what Papers Please has to offer may be boring or not interesting, it is surprisingly intriguing as you realize that the storyline of the game is more than you thought. Papers Please has 20 endings, all of them are dependent on the player's actions. There are entire storylines that can end differently depending on what you do in the game and I recommend playing through the story mode a couple of times just to see how many things could go the opposite way.  After 2 full playthroughs I think it's the engagement the game requires from the player that is so appealing to me and I have to say that I've had a lot more fun with Papers Please than with any other video game that came out this year.

Just like its solid unwavering theme tune, this game is a masterpiece of simplicity and good game design that really builds a sense of tension waiting for the inevitable citation slip every time you give someone the go-ahead to enter.

However unlike Phoenix Wright it is not required to get it right to progress although you get punished for getting it wrong. Deliberately passing people with missing or incorrect papers may even pay off in the story!  Even though the limited color palette and fits the setting really well it gets a little dull after a while. Similarly the gameplay gets very repetitive but I also feel it is part of the charm,1,0

The idea behind the game is simple. Who do you let past the border? The idea is a boring one and you wouldn't expect someone to ever make a game from it. However Papers, Please has me pleasently surprised.  It starts off fairly easy, simply giving you one instruction. However as the days go by you need to be more thorough and you start to question yourself in the end. The difficulty curve is perfect in that it presents you with a challenge and just the right amount of time to add it to your already existing arsenal of abilities that will build up over the time playing the game. The 'story' is actually somewhat compelling.  Overall I do recommend this game, especially for the price,  You would usually look at this game, chuckle to yourself and then move on.

I dont know how many endings there are, but I've played it a few times and each time the ending is different. Some are more favourable than othesr but none are perfect. A few rounds in and the game becomes a bit of a challenge as you have to adapt to the constantly changing rules, increasing layers of beurocracy and an ever-changing political climate, while at the same time trying to protect youself and your family from destitution.

239030,"Papers, Please","At its core, Papers, Please is about reading papers and pressing a stamp to them. You play as a border inspector charged with examining the papers of everyone seeking to cross. This sounds terribly dull, and it's meant to.   But through an expertly crafted narrative, the thankless, monotonous task acquires momentous significance. The player's choices will affect others' lives, whether due to breaking up families by denying a visa or arresting a terrorist attempting to smuggle a bomb through the checkpoint. In this way, paperwork checks can become more important than making sure names and expiration dates are valid because the rulebook tells you to.  Ultimately, the game is a struggle between the player and that very rulebook. The rulebook demands a particlar result in each situation. Early on, you learn that you are rewarded for following it, and punished for deviating. The rules often change from day to day, which can make your task easier or more difficult and thus affect your relationship with the rulebook. But as the game unfolds, you are encouraged, and even pressured, to use more and more discretion even when the rulebook gives you a procedure. By the end, you have a number of competing priorities, and where the rulebook stands on that list is up to you.  Winning in Papers, Please is not about catching all of the discrepancies. It's not even about obtaining a specific ending. It's about taking ownership of your decisions back from the rulebook.",1,0

First, you always have to keep an eye out for forgeries, mistakes and other discrepancies. Second is the pay which is at an all-time low, so it makes it quite hard to feed your family. Third is all these offers from other people claiming that they will give you money, but sometimes, you can't accept because then your job would be at stake. But hey, that's what makes the game so fun! The part that stands out to me most though, is that at every ending, it says 'Glory to Arstotzka.', which I've found can have different meanings depending on how the game ends. If ended in criminalization, 'Glory to Arstotzka.' can mean, 'You don't deserve to be a part of Arstotzka. Glory to the rest of us.'. If ended in doing your job well, it can mean, 'You are accepted as one of us. Glory to all of us, including you.' Three words that say the same thing, but mean different things.

And whether those documents could have been forged; information are correct etc. You flag them out if they are not who the documents specified, or they are suspected smugglers etc.   In the story mode, the checks get harder by the days following the daily news that is happening, and there are cases whereby the immigrant has special reasons to want to get through, but does not have all the necessary documents; or a bribe to get entry when you need the money for your family etc. It all boils down to choices as an inspector, whether it is morally right to allow entry at the expense of breaking the rules, which would mean there will be penalty, or go strictly by the book in a heartless, unwavering fashion.

239030,"Papers, Please","Excellent. Gives great insight into life under tyranny, from an unexpected point of view. Even more important are the parallels to the modern day nanny-surveillance states of the West. Being subjugated to intrusive and humiliating airport security theatre, illegal NSA wiretapping, CCTV monitoring, and constant nanny-state intrusion into our daily lives is the antithesis of being free citizens of a free and democratic state.  Papers, Please should be part of the school curriculum, along with lessons about the nature of tyranny.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I picked this game up purely because I saw it on several recommended video games you have to play due to its unique setup and game mechanics. The premise is deceptively simple but I was shocked over how stressed I was and how intense the gameplay is. The 8-bit graphics add charm and a dystopian feel that I fear that a full-fledged AAA budget would ruin. The sounds are appropriate, the multiple endings means that I still have plenty to discover, and there's a surprising depth to the relationships one forms through very simple interactions with other characters.   Not a game to play if you're trying to hold a conversation with others or there are distractions nearby. Being a Border Agent is serious business.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please. Is a very hard game to talk about. It's literally a paperwork simulator, but it's so oddly engaging.It becomes engaging to a Where's Waldo kind of level when you're trying to compare over 6 different papers to make sure they all match up with each other. Beyond the paperwork, there's such a clever use of narrative without telling that makes this game great. Something I loved was the set up of you having a wife, son, mother in law, and uncle to support. At the end of each day nearly all your money goes to their food and heat, so if you ever want to move up to the upper-class apartments, you've pretty much got no choice but to kill off family members.   This says a lot about who your particular character is. You've got the option to abandon them all and leave the country. You could stick by them and suffer in poverty. What kind of man are you? Who are you?   Is your family more important? Is freedom? Is your country?  Who are you?",1,0

You realise that you can't always just take your time to get it right and be perfect. You have to process a lot of papers just to keep your family fed and warm, and sometimes you have to sacrifice food, or heat, or that present your kid wants, or medicine. You also realise the while someone has all the right paperwork, you might want to take that hit and warning and deny them. That works the other way where you may let someone in intentionally, take the warning or penalty, but it could be for a good reason or bribe. I've seen 1 ending so far, and there are 20 different endings to this, so the choices you make will mean many different possibilites. I got it for $5 but I would say it is worth the retail $10.",1,0

People may say 'The game is meant to be slow, it's the whole idea' but there is definitely a feeling of wading through the marshes that are put off by this game.  Now for the positives.

The player can choose to be the humanitarian, or they can choose to safeguard themselves. In these choices, which seem small at the time, the true message of Papers, Please; emerges. It shows that we are all not so different from one another, though we always exploit those differences.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I started playing 'Papers, Please'. Some friends of mine recommended the game highly and as it was on sale, I bought it. Though the concept behind the game is simple, you're a border cop who is to grant or deny access to your country to people based on the papers and other evidence they provide, it can get quite complex.  The first days of the game introduce new concepts at a fast but manageable pace, steadily adding to the complexity of your task. Though the concept may sound boring, it's actually quite entertaining due to the colourful characters that appear at your booth (some are humorous, some address real-life issues like human trafficking), the puzzle work involved, the cheesy coldwar era communist state setting and the 'reward' overview at the end of every day.  I've only played a couple of hours yet, but am really enjoying the game. Only drawback I have identified is that sometimes people with ok documents and motives blow themselves up after I've granted them access to the country. I've 'retried' these people several times and can find nothing wrong. Maybe these are scripted events to increase difficulty? If so, I would have gladly known about it, as I'm currently unsure what I'm doing wrong. Otherwise a very enjoyable experience.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","The game is simple: Check people's passports and other papers for irregularities and approve or deny them. The appeal of this game is through the complicated situations it puts you in throughout the storyline. You get more money for letting people through, but any mistakes get you a citation. More people (correctly) through the border means more money.  The fine line between keeping your job intact and watching out for your family makes long runs of this game worth the wait.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","So far as I know the only game of it's kind. The art style is beautiful, as is the soundtrack. The gameplay is by no means easy. As soon as you think that you have got the hang of all the little details you must check, another is slammed into your face. Do not think for a second that you can be lazy on the job! The game is pretty unforgiving, if you screw up 3 times in 1 day, a fine is coming your way, making the already very small amount of money you have to take care of your home and family even smaller. The story of the game has multiple endings, based on different choices you make from behind the booth. I won't give anything away, but at one point earlier on in the game you are given a legally questionable choice. It is not until much later in the game that the wrong decision comes back and bites you. You have the ability to go back to any day in all of your playtime which proves very useful for the previously mentioned screw ups.   If you are a fan of indie games, want to hardcore run through a very well developed story, do so. If you just want to chill for a bit, you can do so in the endless mode. I absolutely would recommend this game to anyone.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please",A wonderfully unique and cathartic experience.,1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is perhaps one of the best I've ever played.  Very simplistic in its graphics and gameplay, Papers Please will take you on a joyride full of moral choices and difficult decisions in the Communist country of Arstotzka.  You play as The Inspector, who was unwillingly chosen to man the border of the newly-opened checkpoint in Grestin, an analog to real-life Berlin. Arstotzka and its neighbor, Kolechia, have just fought a war and, with the peace, the border is now open for Arstotzkans to return to the homeland.  Quickly decisions pile up. You can detain people for more money, which could mean the difference between life and death for your family. You can let in a man's love, who has no papers but her passport.   There will be attacks on the checkpoint, in which you are given a rifle and told to fire at the attackers. All while this happens, you are given critical choices which can decide the fate of the nation of Arstotzka.  There are twenty endings in this game, and each one provides something a little different. But with any ending and any playthrough, the writing is absolutely outstanding. You almost feel sympathy for the people as you hammer down 'DENIED' on their passports. The poignancy of this game is never far from the surface. As a simple cog in a vast machine of corruption and depression, you can change lives for the better, or for the worse.   This game deserves every praise it gets. It deserves nothing less than a 10 out of 10.  Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","It's an interesting game with a fascinating idea, well-written and immersive, and will really put you in the shoes of a faceless bureaucrat and to empathize with a kind of person you might otherwise never really see from their viewpoint.  That said, expect to put in a bunch of hours into the game if you like it, and then abandon it. It ratchets up complexity in a way that at first makes the game more challenging and immediate, but eventually just becomes frustrating. Also, since the game never lets up, each new day is far more complicated than the one after that, and so a mechanic that lets you put yourself in the shoes of an opressor ends up feeling far more distancing. Acknowledging the joylessness of a totalitarian state still doesn't make the game fun.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is perhaps one of the most interesting games I've ever played. It's a totally new slant on the criteria for an addicting game. Who knew that doing actual administrative work would be a catch?  In the game, you are shown to have several family members who need food, heat and also medicine. Your salary is tight and a lot of it is spent on your loved ones. This story is told only by plain text after each day's work and checkboxes that allow you to choose whether or not you want to spend money on heating and/or food for your family. It feels as though this is the aspect of the game that provides you with a motive to keep going. Not only this, but the developer has certainly drawn on our inherent nature to find enjoyment in successfully completing tasks that aren't part of our normal lives as they are too difficult or too time-consuming. There is an added frustration aspect when you fail to notice a discrepancy in the documents, which makes getting it right all the more sweeter, just like on a racing game where NOT crashing feels somehow incredibly fulfilling. It is the same case for Papers, Please.   It feels like you build your own strategy on how to complete the game successfully, which is one vital factor that the majority of popular games use to draw you in; building your own strategy and skill grants you more success than others. It’s a single player game but with its timed work clock, it makes it feel like a competitive bubble, where you’re fighting through countless immigrants to feed your family. (Yikes, I wonder how many I can process today!)  The only negative to the game is that due to the fact the game provides you with opportunities to make your own decisions on who to accept, who to help and who to deny means that there are 20 different endings to the game. Sadly, basically all but the last couple of endings warrant a failure of the game. Your inspectors will pull you up on mistakes you make and you will find yourself being quickly arrested if you’ve accidentally ♥♥♥♥ed up somewhere. I’ve played for hours and I keep getting arrested for mistakes I didn’t even know I’d made, I’ve got ending 17 so far. Although the game lets you retrace your steps and choose a workday to restart from, it means that you’re never really sure where to restart from if you mess up. The game only gives you a reason for failure, and you do not get fired for your mistakes until inspection days and official assessments; you don’t know where you messed up so you can’t know which day to go back to. This ultimately ends with giving up. If the developers simply had an indicator of which point you made the mistake, it would be far more appealing to continue playing again, even from an earlier point. Overall, highly addicting game, especially if you don’t make any mistakes. Otherwise, can be frustrating but generally a good gaming experience. You won’t regret buying it, and yes, for once, this game is worth the full price.",1,0

You feel like a member of the stalingrad regime as your wife and children starve and you are unable to pay for the heat...while your father is ill and you need to pay for medicine.

A decade later I saw pixel art style game advertised as a border crossing / document verification simulator. I'd like to say that my biases about judging a book by a cover had been eliminated, but let's be real, they haven't. There are and will continue to be plenty of pixel-art games worth the price of admission, but the subject matter of Papers, Please wasn't immediately exciting.

If everything is in order, you can pass them through the checkpoint. If something is wrong, they either go back to where they came from, or find how comfortable a jail cell is.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please was a highly immersive, beautifuly executed game that conveyed a dreary feeling of hopelessnes. In my review below, I break down the game into categories and analyze it thoroughly.  STORY (Spoiler-free): In 'Papers, Please,' you play as an unnamed border processing guard in the distopian country of Arstotzka, and it focuses on bureaucratic efficiency. I personally loved its story telling and thematic choice system. The entire game presents you with mind-racking choices that have to be made throughout gameplay, but the primary dilema focuses on whether or not you will care about others and their woes, or only look out for you and yours. For example, on one occasion you have the option to wave the rules to reunite a pair of lovers (one of whom has invalid paperwork) but doing so will give you a citation, and can potentially cost you crucial money to keep your family happy &amp; healthy. Choices like these kept the tension high, and present the player with a moral conundrum. Many of the choices you make throughout the game influence the ending in a huge way, with most of the endings differing in content drastically. This highly increases the replayabilty of the game, as you'll want to experience all of the different endings. Overall, the story was well done, oozing with atmosphere, and I give it a 9/10  GAMEPLAY: The Gameplay of 'Papers, Please,' is simplistic, but effective. This is a stress management game, as the goal is to process as many people as possible in the time allotted. As a game should, the gameplay becomes steadily more complex as more layers of paperwork are added for you to check. It starts simple, only having the player check the person's passport, but gets progressively harder as you begin to start checking work permits, discrepancies in various papers, etc. Although the gameplay can become repetitive as time goes on, the new layers added on help to prevent total stagnation. It may nopt be to everyone's liking, but I found it effective and fitting. All-in-all, the gameplay gets a 7/10 from me.  ART &amp; MUSIC STYLE: The graphics in 'Papers, Please,' are simplistic and old-school. It has an almost SNES style of graphics, and it looks pleasing to the eye. The art style conveys the bleak, distopian feeling of the game witha heavy gray color palette, and it adds a fitting atmosphere to the game, as it takes place in a circa 1980 distopian, communist, Eastern European country. Although I can see how the art may not be for everyone, so look at the scfreenshots for exampes of the graphics that are to be expected in the game. The music in the game is low, dark, but paired with a slowly increasing melody of some kind of stringed instrument. It sounds very Eastern European, almost Russian, and is paired well with the setting. When both of these are combined, it paints a picture that fits well with the story, and builds a strong atmosphere. The Art &amp; Music gets an 8/10.  CONCLUSION: 'Papers, Please,' is a well done game, and I applaud the creator for doing such a fantastic job. Even though the gameplay is simplistic, the tension is high and the feel of the game is complementary to the setting. The experience that I had while playing this game was one of intrigue, nail-biting intensity, and mind-breaking dilemas. It's not for everyone, and I think it's best suited to a more story-driven gamer, (as the gameplay consists of little fighting and is mainy reading and the occasional button press) If you enjoy a fun experience that is story driven, unique, and dripping with atmosphere, 'Papers, Please,' is for you. 'Papers, Please,' was a gem that should not be passed up on, as most the gameplay sucks you in and addicts you, and this was one of the best games I've played in a while; so for that reason, my 'Papers, Please' overall rating is a 9/10, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy thought-provoking games, as this is a thinking man's game.  Thanks to anyone who read this, it took a while, and I hope you enjoyed my analysis of the game.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","The premise of this game seems incredibly simple, and doesn't sound like something that could be fun (unless you adore paperwork), but with actually fun gameplay, interesting scenarios that pop up from time to time, and complications that make the gameplay just challenging enough, this is a fantastic game. Don't go in expecting incredible graphics, but a couple hours of fun, oddly difficult decision making, and smart gameplay mechanics.  Also, there are 20 different endings, so it's absolutely replayable. I'm not somebody who particularly enjoys replaying games immediately after finishing them, but I found myself playing days over to see another ending, without ever feeling like it was a chore.  Overall, a brilliant game that had me hooked almost instantly. Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Manning a checkpoint and stamping visas may not sound like gripping gameplay but Papers, Please somehow manages it. With your family on the brink of starvation, political trouble brewing and a cast of characters whose lives you briefly glimpse (and possibly permanently alter) the impetus to be alert and make the right choices is very strong. It's a very hard game to put down.  The graphics may seem basic but they serve the dual purposes of paring back extraneous detail to help you concentrate while simultaneously reinforcing the dreary Cold-War era atmosphere. The moral quandaries you frequently find yourself in (you can barely go a day without being offered multiple bribes for a start) don't usually have clear right or wrong answers. Indeed, whenever I lost (often) I didn't get the impression it was because of any moral failings on my part, just making choices (or mistakes) with harsh consequences.  On the subject of losing, this game has one of the best save systems I've seen. It saves at the end of each day so that you can go back and restart from any day of any playthrough you like. You can go back and fix a mistake you realised from two days ago, or try something different or whatever you like and it displays it all in a way that is easy to navigate.  I'll finish by saying that this game might not be for everyone but I have personally loved it. If the idea of a game that's a bit different, that will make you think, that can actually draw you into the life of a poor worker stuck between a rock and a hard place, this is definitely worth a try. It won't break the bank and it will definitely leave you with an impression.",1,0

You have to check the papers of people getting into the country, and must follow the rules dictated by your superiours. If you don't, you will be fined. There are opportunities to break the rules to help people and sometimes, you may feel like you should take a fine to allow them to pass. At the end of the day, you have to support your family by paying your rent, paying for medicine, food, whatever it takes to survive which you can barely do.  The gameplay is hard and it's easy to overlook something and make a mistake. You have a very limited time to check people in each day and you are payed by how many you check in. There are many different endings, and your choices matter drastically. The endings are basically just a few lines of text though.

239030,"Papers, Please","It's funny--in the age of ultra-realistic graphics and sprawling even-the-kitchen-seek AAA titles, the games I remember most are often the games where I can do the least.  Here, you see people at a checkpoint, then try to keep your family fed and warm at home. People might invite you to post-workplace events ranging from the sordid to the friendly, but you don't go there. They might claim to have interesting lives, but you don't know for sure if you're lying. All you know is the documents they have, the stories they tell, and the regulations that dominate everyone's lives.  Strangely enough, I found myself loving this game's side characters, precisely because I had to imagine their lives, and also because their lives are so obviously more interesting than the task of comparing yet another passport number to yet another government-issued ID.   This isn't the most fun of gameplay (though, despite its similarities to a rather sub-par desk job, the gameplay is strangely hypnotic and relaxing.) But it's a fascinating narrative exercise, and experiment in empathy.  I got to the end of the game once after a few hours of gameplay, and I may not re-play it. But I also can't imagine forgetting it. This is an interesting little restrained story of the game.",1,0

Taking a look at the provided documents by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested. It takes time to look through the documents and then cross checking them with the book and instructions you have been give to decide if you will approve them passing or not.

239030,"Papers, Please","Pros: +Suprisingly addicting gameplay, conisidering that you feel like you're at a day job +Sufficiently intiguing story +Twenty storyline 'outcomes' dictated by player decisions  +Amazing auto-save system. At any point in the story, you can go back and restart from any previous level WITHOUT saving over the original playthrough's saves, essentially creating an alternate save 'branch'. Once you see the save menu, you'll wonder why it's not the standard for all games. Makes achievement hunting a breeze.   Cons: -Low replay value. -No music variety. The songs works, but by the end it got annoying. -Player controls are unlocked like character abilities. For example, at the beginning of the story, the approve/deny stamp is brought out by clicking a small tab at the side of the screen; later on, you buy the 'desk upgrade' that allows you to open the stamp with a keyboard button (a much more convenient and logical control for the most used function in the game). This makes a second playthrough quite annoying, since your muscle memory adapts to the button controls. Seems like a gimic that should've been scraped in testing.   Oddly, I felt that it was too long. The idea works, but 'checking passports and ID's for consistency' is simply too repetetive of a task for a 5-6 hour playthrough. I just think it might've been cleaner if it were shorter. By mid-to-late game, I stopped having any fun and only played through it because I felt invested in the story. Still a thumbs up for a unique and well-executed indie title. At $5, go for it.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please, a very grim and sad game. Let me just tell you this right now: Buy it.  Now that that's been said, allow me to explain a bit about the game itself without spoiling it.  You're a border inspector for cold war, communist, Russia-esque country. There's not much gameplay in the game itself except for stamping passports, which you're probably thinking to yourself now 'Why should I buy a game about stmaping passports?'. Because, at the same time while you stamp passports, you're attempting to maintain your family, giving them food, paying heat, paying off rent. So, you essentially have your sob story. HOWEVER, while you're stamping passports you'll have people without some of their documents and they'll tell you their sob story. They'll either attempt to bribe you so they can go through or just hope that you'll be a saint. So you're juggling around whether you can't afford the tickets for your bills or maybe you'll help this guy. But it only gets worse. You have to do this difficult decisions under time. All the while terrorists are invading you borders, independence factions, smugglers, drug dealers, etc.  There's a LOT more to this game, but unfortunately I don't want to spoil it.

239030,"Papers, Please","It's really hard to convey with words what makes this game interesting. On the surface, this game feels exactly as if you were doing real life work:  - You get a job.  - You are assigned your tasks.  - They feel like a chore.  - You screw up - You get reprimanded - Your responsibilities grow, while your salary stays the same  However, throw in the realities of having a 6 member family to provide for, and it starts getting complicated. Fail to bring home enough money and some family members may have to starve, or freeze. If one of them is sick, you may have to choose between medicine, food, or heating. Will you take bribes then to offset these costs? Will you cooperate with terrorists to get a pay cut? Will you try to get through that gate as many people as you can, since you get paid by the person?   At first it's really easy to make these desicions since you have no sense of what's really going on. After the first few hours go by, and you're grinding along day after day, you start to feel more like playing the character. You start to feel compassion for some of the pixelated people that desperately beg for entry. You start to make judgement calls based on how your family is doing. The game begins to develop into an extremely interesting experience where you're constantly being morally tested.  The game has about 20 or 30-something outcomes (can't remember off the top of my head). So far I've managed to see about 9 of them.

WELL THEN YOU'RE IN LUCK!!!!  This game is a true exploration of what a video game can achieve. Video games aren't all about fantasy, war, dragons, magic and monsters. Papers, Please proves that this medium is limitless. In Papers, Please, you are put in the shoes of a border control agent in the fictional soviet country of Arstotzka, where you are charged with either allowing or denying access of your great country to foreigners and citizens alike, based on an ever-shifting policy handed down to you each morning. You must check backgrounds, passoports, work visas, and make sure everything matches up. But be quick, because you only have so many hours a day and you get paid per customer, and if you try to rush it, you might mess up and cause the poor woman who came through before to be murdered by the man you should have just denied access...

As you progress even further, you may have to examine an endless avalanche of government-issued documents before you stamp the passport, even if we get careless because of the discrepancies we have to examine, and risk being fined 5 credits for a simple yet serious mistake.  For the game's theme, it's a reminescent of the latter cold war years, such as the Divided Germany up until 1989 and its reunification the following year (Sorry, Korea won't count at all). The whole of the Soviet Union under the toughest of entry conditions before the crumbledown on Christmas 1991, in which the key countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, have eased a bit on the entry restrictions. Talk about present-day USA, more than 76% of individuals entered the country legally without even caring that they're classified as terrorists, while the rest of us, law-abiding people, are flagged as terrorists for no reason, even we can't leave the country (Less than .0015% chance on having our exit visas issued)  Even it gives me emotions on an old lady trying to desperately see her own son after six suffering years, and have to deny entry because she doesn't have the documents, or the one she has are purely invalid, but this is the checkpoint officer's duty, nothing else.  The BGM there, yep, that was the remains of Soviet Russia. Graphics? 8-bit creativity in the modern age, and whoever complains about 8-bit creativity in the present day then that's their problem.

239030,"Papers, Please","Very original Game. Yes you need it, simply because it's such a unique thing, but not for 10 bucks. I've spent approximately 20 hours with it - and that includes time spent replaying the game. I may get back at it one day.  Now that we got that out of the way - the Review.   STORY: So you are an immigration inspector at the border of an exagerated communistic nation. Maybe it isn't even THAT exagerated, but the situations posed and the narration make for a deeply comical - but critical - atmosphere. There is a lot of Orwell's '1984' in this game (yea like EVERYBODY talking about that nowadays... OBEY!... but it really fits! *ducks*).  GRAPHICS: The graphics are retro-simplistic but good. I like the graphics, they get the job done.  GAMEPLAY: Now this is where Papers Please defines itself - well apart from the bizarre scenario it imposes upon you. You have to grant people access to your country - or deny them - based on the correctness of the formulae and documents they present to you. You need to check if their Birthdate, Gender and Photograph match and make sense - and the further you progress - the more things need checking. For example after a certain day all immigrating workers also need a working permit, and the game expands upon this more and more the further you go.  If you make a correct decision, you earn money. If you make too many incorrect decisions - you have to pay a fine. Simple as that.  Paper checking is done by dragging and dropping the documents on your tiny desk (you well need to do A LOT of paperwork readjustments on your tiny wooden table in the late game) and comparing the given documents to the 'Rules and Regulations'. If there are inconsistencies, you need to highlight a the incorrect thing in the passport (or any given document) and the corresponding rule that states that it is incorrect. Simple as that, but it sounds utterly confusing in text. After you have done this - the passport needs to be stamped with either 'Access Granted' or 'Denied'.  Basically it's like a paperwork simulator!  Based on your successes at the job, you then need to make sure you can pay for your family's nourishment and the heat in your apartment. So if you have a bad day - they might just starve to death and you are game over. And just to screw you up, occasionally it turns out you need to feed your sick uncle and mother or whathaveyou.  STORY2: Now i know, i have already talked about the story, but this game's gameplay is like its story that's why i pick it up again. It's an odd interweaving of events that make your decisions of letting people through - or not - matter. Basically every immigrant has something unique to say (the writing is excellent btw), but some of them are even more unique and the plot is dictated by whether or not you let them through. But there is no indication that this is the case, which is what makes this game so awesome in the first playthrough. You have this really weird feeling sometimes that the games got you by the balls, and you have this strange fear of screwing up. It must be the weirdest thing i have played and there is nothing i can really compare it to - but it has this really deep atmosphere, like in Gothic 1 - the first time you played it 15 years ago. That's as accurate as i can get, and i know comparing it to a 3D open world RPG from 200X must seem ridiculous, but that might just prove how crazy this game is.  AUDIO: Super crisp paper sounds. I mean seriously. Stamping a document in this game is as satisfying as firing a gun in an immersive fps! So odd...  Now i know this review might not manage to sum up the game in it's entirety - but due to the fact that it is very story reliant, i would probably start spoiling the fun if i wrote more. Just get it and be surprised by it.  GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This is the most jarring and stressful paperwork/bureaucracy simulator in the games industry, but it still manages to be fun and tense. It has a very good story, interesting characters, and great replayability.   My issues with it are nearly non-existent, the stamping method irritates me, I'd prefer seperate stamps, and my other, much larger issue is the fact that the 'invisible' checkpoint immediately after yours ALWAYS notices discrepencies.These are relatively small compared to my overall love of the game. Get it.   9.7/10",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","'Glory to Arstotzka' Papers, Please is a true gem of an Indie title. With It's minimalist graphics and dreary color pallete, the feeling of an iron curtain border checkpoint is conveyed without equal. The game mechanics start out simple, with you only needing to examine one or two pieces of information, but by the end, you will need to be on the tips of your toes, scanning many documents for discrepencies in a matter of seconds. The game has 20 different endings, but only 3 or so of them are actually different. You have the option of doing your job without question, supporting the insurgent group trying to bring down the government, or fleeing the country. All of these different endings have fun twists to them, and are all worth trying to get. If you are looking for a fantastic game, this is it.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A great indie game, well worth the price. I played through a couple of possible endings and had fun trying different options - eventually this gets a bit boring and unless you like to hunt achievements, the game becomes repetitive.

There are a lot of funny moments and tough decisions to be enjoyed, which makes me recommend 'Papers, Please'",1,0

The game requires you to be very attentive as you need to make sure that all the documents are in order. You also need to make personal decisions on whether to let people in despite the fact they lack the required documents, but are facing persecution or are part of a group trying to make a revolution in Arstotzka, among others.

239030,"Papers, Please","Never did I think that a game with graphics that make MS-DOS games feel groundbreaking, a repeditive gameplaym barely any sound mentionable, shallow story and few objectives could be so good, This game really show that the sum is greater than it's parts. I don't know what is with this game but it is magical.  Basically the game is about you being a border guard checking papers at a border between two fictional nations. It all gives the impression being in some sort of eastern-European state during behind the iron curtain during the Soviet era. Your task is to either admit och reject those who seek to enter based on the papers provided and the requirements set by your superiors. You simply scan these papers for faults. You have to do this fast enough to feed your poor family as the time is limited and you are paid per person reviewed. All errors lead to a salary reduction. Sometimes you stand between wrong admitting a person who just wish to be with its beloved, sometimes to accept bribes and sometimes you choose between aiding a terrorist organisation or fact the consequenses of not doing so.  I suppose it is all the context of the game that makes the magic. You strangely enough get sucked into it.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","working as bank teller irl, this game is strangely compelling and feels all too familar to me.   while years of abuse from customers working in banks and retail has made me numb to the moral dilemmas that you face in the game, I can appreciate the game's attempts to pull at my heartstrings and morals as they throw all of the 'immigration' cliches at me: -Let a terrorist in, or, apprehend a terrorist at the gate while yelling ALL GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA -Wrongly accuse someone of being the wrong gender -Seperate man and wife at the gate.  -Get irritated with the crazy old man who comes everyday with the wrong paper work -prevent the plot of Liam Neeson's 'Taken'   the only real problem I have with the game is pacing. After like 30-40 people in a row, I'd like to think most normal people get nauseous or bored. The fact that there is 20 different endings based on how you play and who you let in greatly extends the replay value if you can physically and mentally will yourself to play the game more than 2 or 3 times all the way through. And there's even a endless mode for the most mentally depraved of us out there  I can definitely recommend the game if you can pick it up for cheap in a Steam sale.

I'm definitely intrigued by it, and the salary menu at the end of each level kinda terrifies me. Pretty much, if you don't make enough to support your family they'll get cold/sick/hungry and will die. Sure, this is a worry people have in real life, but a digital family that has no names or faces, just 'Son' and 'Wife,' is a little unnerving.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a fun game, but there are some flaws that I feel are often swept under the rug because of the game's admirable, but indie status. The game makes you believe that this is a game that will revolve around choice. The truth is, it's quite the opposite. Much like the strong communistic element present in this game, the choices in this game come sparingly, and the consequences are almost always fatal. This game is more akin to a platformer in that there are a few but very linear paths you can take to reach the 'end.' Stray from that, and the game is absolute. This isnt always bad, but nearly is always punishing. Its a fun game, but I found it greatly overhyped, and equal parts fun and frustrating.",1,0

The added moral pressure of whether or not to let in the young couple without documents who will surely be killed without an approved visa notwithstanding. This game will have you tearing your hair out in locks.   Thing is though, Papers, Please isn't about having fun. The game is about winning. It's about beating the corrupt Arstotzkan government, with small victories like being able to pay your rent, or full blown revolution. It's about the small satisfaction of catching the tiniest discrepancy in four pages of documents.   This game is amazing, totally original, and immensely challenging.

All the small details add up to produce a scene and atmosphere that you would think impossible given the simple interface and graphics but it pulls it off quite brilliantly.

In the game you are a worker at a boarder checkpoint, but this is covered in the discription so i wont go into much detail. Most of the gameplay consists of managing papers and deciding if all the papers are in order and sending off into the county. It starts off easy but slowly becomes harder as you have to manage up to 15 things to check by end game. I do not want to spoil too much of the endnings as there are 15 i belive, however I encorage you to get this game. It is a look into your own self conscious. Will you listen to the sob story of a random person you have never met and let them in or will you save that five dollars you get for turning her away to buy medicine for your dying son.

There is a bit of a story line which I've only gotten a glimpse of. There are also some moral decisions to make as to whether or not to grant access to people, who don't have the correct documents but claim that they are in danger.

I like the idea of really flipping through the pages of a book (in-game) looking for the references you need and comparing them to the documents presented to you. Feels really great. The addition of feeling the pressure of processing as many people's papers as you can possibly manage in one shift to earn as much money as you can so you can support your family is also great. You don't have vast expanes of time to sift through every possible thing there could be wrong about the documents or you simply won't earn enough money. That plus the fact that when you make too many mistakes your paycheck gets cut back makes this a nice challenge.

In this game, you live in the made-up Communist nation of Arstotzka and your name has been drawn in a 'labor lottery' which I have never heard of before, but I imagine is similar to jury duty in America. The particular job you have been given (regardless of whether you want it, because hey, it's communism) is to be a border checkpoint worker. Your family is given a house to live in, but you must provide enough money to keep them safe and sound.  This game starts off quite linear and intriguing as you admit or decline people based on their paperwork and the rules you are issued everyday before starting. As time goes on however, events happen and more rules are added into your book to help ensure the safety of Arstotzka. Each day, you only have so much time to process people and that puts a lot of pressure on you because you have a family you have to pay the bills for.   This game presents you with many choices throughout. Some of these are moral choices or opportunities to make some money. Not all the opportunities are legal though...How much are you willing to do to compromise the nation's security to make sure you have food on the table? There are twenty different endings and the game makes you feel like your decisions actually matter.  As far as gameplay alone goes during the process of admitting applicants, it is actually exhilarating. You know you need to do a good job of examing their paperwork so that you don't lose money or even your job, but you also just want to work as fast as possible to get more money for your son's medication, or to pay the heat bill, or whatever the game throws at you. The rules constantly change and evolve with the times and it makes gameplay an enthusiastic struggle of work ethics, money, and guilt.   I cannot say how thoroughly impressed I am that one man alone made this game. It is definitely worth playing. 10/10.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","C-64 graphics but high quality sounds. You are an inspector on the borders of a (fictional) communist country in the early 80's. You decide who enters, who has to leave and sometimes who will be detained. The paycheck isn't really worth to mention, so you have to keep your eyes open for opportunities, that are always containing some risks.   An amazing, dark atmospheric game, well balanced, with intresting descitions to make. Multiple endings complete a nice game that contains story elements but doesnt feel too linear at the same time.   Really love it!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Brilliant game where you play an immigration officer in fictional cold-war state. The concept is easy enough to understand, but the game is very strict. A new rule or regulations regarding immigrants is added nearly every day.  This means you have to check more documents for validity, all while trying to process enough people every day so you can make enough money to feed your family and keep them warm. The story mode (which has 20 different endings!) adds an extra dimension to the game, terrorists and secret organizations are trying to get into the country and it's up to you to prevent them or not, but your choice will have consequences either way. This all is interspersed with some great humour which is the proverbial cherry on top. I would recommend this game to anyone ever!",1,0

There are those indy games that you play for a few days and then never really look at again, but 'Papers, Please' grabs your attention with a slow build of very intense character interactions that are all based on whether or not you have all the correct papers to gain entrance at a immigration check point. It delves into corrupt politics, threatening scare tactics, and dealing with bomb smuggling terrorists, and people offering you bribes for entry into your gate. Its more intense and connecting that I thought and all the hidden espionage is definietly something that keeps your playing just to figure out how you got yourself into this situation where you are left with bombs, tranq gunning people down, and hoping not to ♥♥♥♥ of your over-seers.",1,0

Papers, Please   gives us the opportunity to step into the shoes of someone living there in a few hours.

The charm of   Papers, Please   comes from the various side events and your constant struggle between your duty as an inspector and your responsibility of providing to your family.  I find the low fidelity art and music rather apt to the narrative of the game and the booming theme is forever seared into my brain.

At first, reviewing a bunch of papers may sound boring, but it is really well done and it a satisfying experience when you get it right. If you are a meticulous person then I think you will definitely like it.  But the game isn't really about reviewing papers without making any mistakes. It is about the choices you make in this poor, communist, conflicted society. Do you allow an ill woman to pass through the gates without having all the proper papers so that she can receive the treatment that she requires, knowing that you will be punished for it and lose the money you need to feed your starving family with?

Yes? Then Papers, Please is the game for you. Much has been made of the immersive world born from this simple paperwork simulator, and, from what I've experienced myself, its no joke. I could feel the world around me turn grayer as I delved into the glorious land of Arstozka. Its a world that terrifies and interests me in equal measure.

239030,"Papers, Please","Death in video games is something that usually has little impact upon a player. You routinely kill thousands upon thousands of virtual foes and death or failure means teleporting back to a checkpoint. But here, death and failure are extremely psychologically taxing. The sound of a printing citation telling me that 5 credits would be deducted from my pay because I misprocessed someone was a sound that I dreaded and made me flinch everytime I heard it, because it meant I wouldn't be able to cure a family member of disease. A friend died and I replayed a day 6 times over just so that I could save him, because he was the only friend I had. The pixel art faces that come up to your door begin to feel more human than most video game characters rendered in 3D. This game is a masterpiece.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I haven't even finished this game yet and it still haunts me. It's simple premise and retro 8-bit graphics are a smoke screen for a game that is emotionally daunting. This game literally manages to stare into your soul and reveal who you really are or at the very least who you could be given the right circumstances. It reminded me of the Democracy games from Positech in the sense that you think it's a one-person-made-this point and click game with simple graphics but very soon you all of a sudden realize what it's like to be in that character's shoes and why characters like that are the way they are in real life. In the Democracy games, you understand why politicians act the way they do. In Papers Please, you understand by government security bureaucrats act the way they do. It's sounds silly but you will not regret the experience. In terms of most important games of all time that have an emotional impact on you, I'll easily put this up there with Myst, Final Fantasy VII, and the Bioshock series. Buy this game.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a game where you take on the role of an Arstotzkan (Russian) immigration inspctor and you must follow strict rules that change each day or else you won't make enough money to keep your family alive...   When you start playing this game it kind of feels like you actually just got a new job. You learn as you go but learn fast because you only get a handful of warnings before you're fired   sent to jail  . This is by no means a bad thing however as it adds a sense of constant worry and actually gives you a reason to want to do very well. The game throws moral choices at you and can actually get you pretty emotioanally involved. My fist time playing the game, I was so into the story that when I finally lost, I realized that 2 hours had gone by.   If you like a good story with retro graphics, memory skill, and reflex based gameplay, then this one's for you.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is the sort of game I can recommend, but not for an extended amount of time. A game that appears designed eventually destroy you in the manner of an old-school game of Frogger is deeply stressful for me, especially when combined with bureaucracy and the sound of a dot matrix printer reporting my failure.  The goal is to pass people through your gate. Each person you admit gives you some income, which you will never have enough of. Each day the time allowed remains the same, but the requirements grow more and more elaborate and detailed, and you lose money if you admit someone or deny them incorrectly.   It's well made, and after a while you find yourself concocting patterns for how to get through the various searches as fast as possible, but the games whole point is the futility of an ever thickening bureaucratic set of rules and permissions without increased time and labor to support it.  There's this notion that people and charge can demand things 'better, faster, cheaper' and get results, but the phrase 'Good, fast, cheap, pick two' more apt when it came to results. While Papers, Please is a perfectly fun game on the surface level, it quickly demands you ask some uncomfortable questions.

239030,"Papers, Please","Something about this game was really enjoyable. It's not action packed but it has an intriguing story.  It's a bit of a point-and-click your way through your job, but that seems like it would be fairly realistic. The player is forced to monotonously dig through dates and seals of approvals to spot fake paperwork, just like the real border guards. The rules for required documentation was also changing from day to day which makes life harder for both border guards and immigrants.   One component of the game is feeding your family. If you can't work fast enough your family will go broke and you will go to jail for unpaid bills. I was playing on a trackpad and had a hard time with this. Fortunately the game comes with an easier difficulty setting that gives you some help with reaching your quota. Even with this setting on the game can still present interesting dilemmas and moral decisions.   It has a few different endings depending on the choices you made.

On a farm.' And until they played it, they didn't 'get' it. Why it was so amazing. Why it was so fun. That's EXACTLY what this game is like. You're at a customs desk, checking passports.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is the best game I have played in the last year.  On the surface it is a biroucratic simulator where the only thing preventing terrorist, human trafickers and smugglers is your ability to find discrepanices in their paperwork. There are also moral decisions to be made when people are begging you to let them through even though they don't have the necessary papers. You can follow the rules and doom them or you can let them slip but that comes at your expense because you are getting penalized for every mistake you make and you have to earn enough money to feed your family.   If you follow the rules you are the bad guy, if you let every sob-story affect you your family will starve. And the game is brilliant because of it. Every aspect of it - ugly graphics, dark colour palette, primitive tools that are at your disposable add to the atmosphere. And when in that dark atmosphere arrives a moment of humor it really brights you up.  The game was done by a single guy and he has done a great job. This is the game you should really play.

'Papers, Please' is an addictive masterpiece, encompassing hummor and morality, as well as mortality. As simplistic tasks become more and more complicated, taking longer to perform, and holding a more intense weight over the livelihood of you and your loved ones, our ideas of morality change. Between bribes, corruption, sabotage, and simple cold-heartedness, the game knows exactly how to get at you, as you race to the end, trying only to survive.  When I tried to explain the game's mechanics to my friends, they were put off by the concepts. In our minds, a paperpusher does not make a great game. Yet everyone whom I've demonstrated to, or let play have expressed their own interest, many of whom bought the game for themselves.

239030,"Papers, Please","This game seems to be dividing the indie community. Some call it a bland 'data checking' simulation, and they'd be right. Some call it a fantastic insight into 'eastern block' mentality and they'd be right.  In brief, in this game you play a border visa inspector, you perform well and do your duty, the state will reward you. You made mistakes, get sloppy, even get sympathetic to the resistance... then you better watch out.  In a very discreet way, this game probes your good and bad from your right and wrong. Very often you'll have someone who comes to the border that you know you SHOULD grant entry to, as all the paperwork is correct, but you know it may have negative results. Then again, you have someone who has no legitimate paperwork and yet you know the right thing to do morally is to let them in.  Overall, it is rather a bland, mundane game... but that's exactly the point, the subject matter ISN'T exciting or stimulating, if you were an actual border guard, your job simple IS to check the details are all proper and correct, but the scenarios and moral questions this game poses is quite unique and well worth playing.

You spend the daytime in your office, doing a repetitive task, in a dull and boring environnement. You go back home in the evening, worried about your family members getting ill and bills to pay. And you have to perform well at work, for you salary is based on your productivity.  This is quite stressful and you definitely don't want to go for another work routine when you log on steam.

This game actually is fairly solid at it's core, with interesting gameplay mechanics. You'll quickly be amazed by how easy it is to make mistakes in judging someone's legal documents and how many layers of control this game offers. It has more depth than meets the eye. It's great even at what it does. Do keep in mind that the aesthetics are a bit rough in this pixel art style and it remains to be seen how all things combined will influence the game's longetivity. But I've already had a good few hours of fun with this and probably will occasionally play some more. It's also the only game I know of in it's genre of 'border patrol' style gaming. Add to that random events like terrorist bombings, people you have/can detain for human trafficking and it's quite a cool spin on the simulation genre. The stalinistic setting is nice and adds to the overall experience. The low pay with a direct impact on your own family can be a bit crude at times, but it's a nice touch.

239030,"Papers, Please","Very original Game. Yes you need it, simply because it's such a unique thing, but not for 10 bucks. I've spent approximately 20 hours with it - and that includes time spent replaying the game. I may get back at it one day.  Now that we got that out of the way - the Review.   STORY: So you are an immigration inspector at the border of an exagerated communistic nation. Maybe it isn't even THAT exagerated, but the situations posed and the narration make for a deeply comical - but critical - atmosphere. There is a lot of Orwell's '1984' in this game (yea like EVERYBODY talking about that nowadays... OBEY!... but it really fits! *ducks*).  GRAPHICS: The graphics are retro-simplistic but good. I like the graphics, they get the job done.  GAMEPLAY: Now this is where Papers Please defines itself - well apart from the bizarre scenario it imposes upon you. You have to grant people access to your country - or deny them - based on the correctness of the formulae and documents they present to you. You need to check if their Birthdate, Gender and Photograph match and make sense - and the further you progress - the more things need checking. For example after a certain day all immigrating workers also need a working permit, and the game expands upon this more and more the further you go.  If you make a correct decision, you earn money. If you make too many incorrect decisions - you have to pay a fine. Simple as that.  Paper checking is done by dragging and dropping the documents on your tiny desk (you well need to do A LOT of paperwork readjustments on your tiny wooden table in the late game) and comparing the given documents to the 'Rules and Regulations'. If there are inconsistencies, you need to highlight a the incorrect thing in the passport (or any given document) and the corresponding rule that states that it is incorrect. Simple as that, but it sounds utterly confusing in text. After you have done this - the passport needs to be stamped with either 'Access Granted' or 'Denied'.  Basically it's like a paperwork simulator!  Based on your successes at the job, you then need to make sure you can pay for your family's nourishment and the heat in your apartment. So if you have a bad day - they might just starve to death and you are game over. And just to screw you up, occasionally it turns out you need to feed your sick uncle and mother or whathaveyou.  STORY2: Now i know, i have already talked about the story, but this game's gameplay is like its story that's why i pick it up again. It's an odd interweaving of events that make your decisions of letting people through - or not - matter. Basically every immigrant has something unique to say (the writing is excellent btw), but some of them are even more unique and the plot is dictated by whether or not you let them through. But there is no indication that this is the case, which is what makes this game so awesome in the first playthrough. You have this really weird feeling sometimes that the games got you by the balls, and you have this strange fear of screwing up. It must be the weirdest thing i have played and there is nothing i can really compare it to - but it has this really deep atmosphere, like in Gothic 1 - the first time you played it 15 years ago. That's as accurate as i can get, and i know comparing it to a 3D open world RPG from 200X must seem ridiculous, but that might just prove how crazy this game is.  AUDIO: Super crisp paper sounds. I mean seriously. Stamping a document in this game is as satisfying as firing a gun in an immersive fps! So odd...  Now i know this review might not manage to sum up the game in it's entirety - but due to the fact that it is very story reliant, i would probably start spoiling the fun if i wrote more. Just get it and be surprised by it.  GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Having seen many immigrants in my own country that is located somewhere next to the South China Sea, Papers, Please is a great thriller that challenges you to be an immigrant officer who either approves or reject immigrant for the glory of Arstotzka.  The UI is simple to understand and use while the overall presentation reminded me of the good old school graphics of the late 80s which I enjoy a lot (brought up with Sierra adventure games). The low resolution display couple with the limited colour help to enhance the abstract feel of the game with the player filling in the extra details in their own mind.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please had me hooked for a short while. In a weird, yet fun way I would start it up, bob my head to the music, and pretend that I was 'going to work' again.   The game starts you off tame and picks up momentum, forcing you to remember initial tasks and methods while learning new ones each day that passes. I had great fun in these mini-games (if that is what you would call them) such as denying a citizen or finding that tiny discrepency that allowed me to use an X-ray and find that contraband or weapon only to have the poor person hauled away (most likely for execution).   However, for whatever reason I stopped playing and although I have thought about picking back up where I left off several times over the past few months, I haven't been able to get myself to do so. This is where I ultimately land with this game, that is, its fun if you play it and stick with it (and if you have an interest in this sort of puzzle-ish, organizational memory-game). However, if you allow any amount of time in between playthroughs that is too great, I think you'll find it somewhat tedious and difficult to get back into the swing of things. If I were to go back now, I'd have to basically re-learn everything from the beginning just to keep up with where I was when I left off - and this is not the most appealing thought, at least to me.   Papers, Please is unique and definitely well crafted. The gameplay is tight, the visuals have a pleasing, retro feel, and the challenge is definitely there for those that love to one-up themselves on a second or third playthrough. It just, for several reasons mentioned and not (as I'm sure I missed a few), doesn't hold my interest enought to want to actually play it - and this is why I'd give P,P a 7.5/10.   Maybe it's just not for me after all.... :/",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Damn, is this game tricky. Not in the 'How do I get past this jump that looks impossible?' way, but the 'How the hell did I miss that?!' way.  Your goal is to get as many people through the border checkpoint as possible without breaking the rules. The more people that you deal with, the more you get paid. But the rules change day by day and based on what actions you take; let a bomber through? The day ends and you have new rules to follow. Miss a violation? Do that 3 times and you lose money for the 3rd time on. If you were on your own I could care less, but you have 4 other family members to take care of so every penny counts. 5 days into my first playthrough and my Son is dead, my Uncle is sick and everyone is cold and hungry... holy ♥♥♥♥.  It's bleak, the art style has you wondering where the nearest suicide booth is and generally it's just a dull trudge to get your guy through each day on the job and not kill your entire family... so in that sense, it's what I imagine working in the formor Soviet bloc was like.  Definatly a game that I count as an 'art game', but not one that relies on weird visuals and wonky mechanics to try and evoke something in the player. This game has smile mechanics and a washed-out color pallet that, again, makes it feel as if you really are trudging through each work day and just managing to get by. Just from that, it does what it set out to do and evokes something in the player.   It's worth picking up if you can find it cheap or on sale.

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is just  brilliant . I'd like to give kudos to the creator, Lucas Pope, who did about everything (code, artwork, sound, story) this is a darn good accomplishment, and even more so with its success.  However, like many games it's  not for everyone . Its not an action/shooter/platformer twitch reaction type game (though a few segments are reflex based). Its closer to a 'point and click' or a 'spot the differences' type game, only many times there aren't any differences and/or there's multiple actions you could perform with various results some long term.  What would normally be considered work is somehow fun in this game. I don't quite understand it which piques my interest even more. Verifying passports and documents and stamping them sounds like a terrible game, but somehow its not. Trust me after the first few days/levels you'll be questioning why this is fun.  The story mode is great and builds up the difficulty as you progress. It is also rather humorous and as previously mentioned some decisions have reprecussions later in the game. The save system is great; saving for each day and allows you to go back to any previous day and start a new timeline and make different choices save each day of the new timeline.  Once you 'beat' the game, basically finish each levels/days   and escape   you unlock the endless modes. Where you can compete globally or locally/against yourself or just play for fun in 4 different modes with 4 different difficulty levels (in effect 16 combinations).  There are 20 different 'endings' I believe, several are being jailed/executed for different reasons, some have a 'happy' ending at least as happy as an ending can be in a dystopia, some are based on decisions you make halfway through the game. On top of the endings to complete there are various tokens and achievements to get if you are into that sort of thing. These last few things and endless modes give replayability but not an enourmous amount; 5-15 hours I'd say maybe more if you're a completionist and/or very competitive.  If you are into puzzle/mind thinking games pick this up. If you just want to kill terrorists/robots/aliens/monsters/etc then as I said at the beginning, this isn't for you.",1,0

You have to do this fast enough to feed your poor family as the time is limited and you are paid per person reviewed. All errors lead to a salary reduction. Sometimes you stand between wrong admitting a person who just wish to be with its beloved, sometimes to accept bribes and sometimes you choose between aiding a terrorist organisation or fact the consequenses of not doing so.  I suppose it is all the context of the game that makes the magic. You strangely enough get sucked into it.",1,0

This game is meaningful, resonant, and features more cohesive, focused integration of story into gameplay and vice versa than I have ever seen.

The moral choices you have to make throughout, and the cramped, claustrophobic nature of the game's layout is brilliant, and unnerving.

Checking passport numbers? pictures? stamping card? oh, what incredible fun &lt;/sarcasm&gt;  Then, I played it... Sure, memorising the countries, major towns, districts and keeping an eye on the date was a pain... but when sabotage, espionage, complicated underlying struggles of day-to-day life and the strange memory of my time doing similar things as an actual job... I am actually enjoying this game! hang on, need to scan someone for a bomb because their weight does not add up to their ID card. Their city matches, but I saw them earlier with a fake passport! I need to make sure I don't let a terrorist through or it might be me they blow up next! ACK! I didn't check the name on that last worker permit! After stuffing up the forged stamp on the other two, i'm getting my pay docked! Thank goodness i'm in with a guard who'se cutting me a slice of his bonus for my arresting folks with illegal info or I wouldn't be able to feed my family, pay for my sick mother-in-law's medicine or keep the house warm... I'm trying to save up for a bigger apartment too, but I doubt i'm going to get enough money after that incident with the secret sect I turned in...  It's not for everyone, but if you have a halfway decent memory (or a handy note-book like me) you will do well from the get-go. Work fast, focus hard and provide for your family...  Stay sly, work on the side and crack the code given to you be smart, keep yourself under the radar and don't get arrested. Day by day, you will face discrete small-world problems... but other days, you may find you help make the news!  This is not your standard game. This is a bit of a work-sim!

239030,"Papers, Please","In short, I enjoyed this game quite a bit. I'm the kind of person that enjoys actions that require thought, vigilance, and has an impact and purpose, despite it maybe looking mundane from afar. This game is an execptional example of how something that looks sooooo boring can honestly be fun. Each decision, wether done correctly or not, will either compromise your morals, or your family. I feel that this game balances it's new concepts exceptionally well, although maybe failling once to see that you need to do more things faster. I truly am addicted to this game. The characters, though short lived, and few make reappearances, have thier own story. It is amazing how this game says so much about a single character through their face, and a few short sentences. The endings are grim and plentiful, always imbuing a sense of ridiculous failure despite the game's often unreasonable difficulty (which I don't think is a flaw in the game, but more an element of the world [or at least the countriy] the characters lives in). I reccomend this game to people that enjoy the story in a game more than the gameplay, because the only way of the gameplay evolves is through adding more things to do on top of what you already have, making each immigrant more time-consuming to deal with each day. I can't really say that more action orriented gamers or people with low attention spans will enjoy this. Also, if you have a low threshold for sad events, you probably won't like this game either.  This game recieves a 8/10 I feel it hits most of the marks I look for in a game. The story is enthralling, the presentation is absolutley stunning, but the gameplay is somewhat lacking variety and kind of repetive. I haven't found all the endings yet, not even close, but I expect that the true ending (did I mention this game has 40 endings?) will be fulfilling or, more likely, disasterous.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A lot of people at the interwebs have hyped this game a lot, and they have also said pretty much anything that there is to say about it. I suppose I can try to summarize my own thoughts about it though. So here we go.  This game does exactly what it sets out to do. It puts you into some interesting situations, and your choises will have en effect on your own story. I really like this system that they have, and I also like the fact that there are many different endings you can get. Get arrested, get your entire family killed and so on. Real fun stuff.  It is quite interesting to interact with people in this game. You meet them, they give you papers, you check them, and the people leave. But sometimes, things can go very different. People can attack the border,give you secret messages, and beg for you to let them into the country when they don't own a passport. You can choose how you handle those situations. Brake the law in order help someone, or arrest a murderer without having proof.   The game does get harder when you get closer to the end. More things to remember, more choises to make and more papers to please I mean check. However, this does mean that the start of the game is not nearly as interesting as the end game.The length of Papers, please pretty much debends on your own skill. I'd say that clearing all 31 days does take about 5-6 hours. However, I don't really think that this game has huge amounts of replay value. Sure you can try to unlock all the endings, but I highly doubt that most people will.  So do I think that Papers, Please is worth all the hype? I would not say so. Don't get me wrong, I do like the game, I would even call it pretty good. But I still think that some people give it way too much credit. My overall rating for Papers, Please is a 7 out of 10.

239030,"Papers, Please","8/10: Work loyally as border inspector, decide who may enter glorious homeland or return from whence they came. Survive attacks and thwart smugglers until audit comes at the end of thirty days! Glory to Arstotzka!   This game is heavy. The atmosphere is heavy, with the only music being the deep march of the starting screen. Meanwhile, the graphics, reminiscent of NES graphics and earlier, combine well with the garbled speech that only ever seems to sound like 'gestaht' (gestalt? get out? pretty authoritative and germanic sounding) or 'hayaku' (japanese for faster?). Even the core action is heavy, forcing you to focus on the tedium of finding discrepancies in the paperwork of immigrants lest you return home with less pay for food and heating.   Yet just because it isn't strictly fun in the 'Saints Row' sense of reckless abandon and indulgence, doesn't mean 'Papers, Please' isn't engaging. The stress of living out each day, pulled between the attention of your family, your country, and the enigmatic Order of the EZIC Star. Loyalty has its rewards, but any inkling of seditiouis activity may lead to a most miserable end. Thus, it is up to you who to help, both on an individual level and on society at large.   Personally, I was intrigued by the procedurally generated people interspersed between the scheduled characters. Jorji Costava was undoubtedly the one glimmer of comic relief amongst the procession of separated families and sly smugglers. Right when I saw that passport from 'Cobrastan' I knew he'd be my number one source of warnings, though I thankfully managed to never have pay taken away via excessive citations.  While I generally took pride in getting no citations and returning with plenty for my family, I took exception with truly momentous events, especially since I wanted to get all the foreign coins in one playthrough. In particular, reuniting Sergiu with his love was sweet, and there was a grim satisfaction in going along with the vengeful fathers plan to murder Simon Wens, the man who killed his daughter.   Nonetheless, this is definitely a melancholy game as a whole, and is all the better for it. Rather than the shiny, happy veneer one might find in free to play or corporate games, 'Papers, Please' confronts the anxiety of being an unassuming, yet critical, cog in the machine. Feeling powerless, yet potentially influencing the development of these shifting nations, with you being the decider of who permeates the membrane between them. It's an interesting position to be in, even if the mechanics aren't as exhilirating as one typically expects from a game.",1,0

This game takes place in a made up country called Arstotzka, and you are a person pulled in the labor lottery to work at the new border checkpoint. Though at first it seems very simple elements are quickly added to make you decide between speed and quality, and the wrong choice could get you exacuted. Random events happen throughout the pre-made story to make you go against or for your country. Also you meet intresting characters that you see time and time again and make you smile and you are evaluated on how well you do your job, needless to say you will probably be told you are scum several times over each day. There is a struggle that feels almost too real in this game where you are trying to make ends meat, making almost nothing and supporting an entire family on that.

239030,"Papers, Please","Having always wanted to pay for the pleasure of doing menial tasks whilst living under the oppression of an Orwellian state, I went into Papers please with very high hopes.  On starting the game, I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of digits and names that had to be cross-checked and I was enjoyign my first day as a guradian of the Democratic Republic immensely before the day ended and I was forced to return home to my parasitic family. This opened up the second key part of the game, being depressed as loved ones die because you, as sole family provider, were too busy apprehending criminals in the name of mother  Russia  Arstotzka. This in the end turned out to be very useful as one family member dying really frees up funds to pay for medicine or expensive crayon sets and keep the others alive.  As the game went on I found that a significant amount of nothing happened, which really livened up the experience and made me wish that exciting things like dening people entry would happen less frequently, however I then began to see the value of things happening in video games as it helps to compartmentalise the long stretches of enjoyable bureaucracy.  In conclusion, more games need to make me feel completely bored and slightly depressed, then maybe they too could have as much praise as I'm dropping onto Papers Please. Also Papers Please is what we in the industry call 'enjoyable', we also say that it 'contains gameplay' which may sound strange in this day of 10 minute long cutscenes, but surprisingly it actually contributes to the experience if the player is occasionally allowed to take control of the protagonist.  -Glory to Arstotzka  -Your Comrade Delta_Lemon",1,0

You'd think that would make me dislike it... but I very quickly got caught up in the plot, which seems for the most part to be going on outside of my little booth. The game is unlike any other I've played, and it was weirdly intriguing to play a game in which I'm just some random outsider just trying to get into the 'in' crowd.   Somewhere out there, a revolution is brewing... and the player has almost nothing to do with it. But still, it's exciting, and by the time you start thinking, 'OK, that's enough paperwork...' the game throws another curveball. The only thing that seems under-done is the main character's life outside of work -- there's some peripheral talk of food and health and heat and whatnot, but it's mostly as a lever to give the player incentives to act one way or another. It'd have been nice to get more involved in that side of the story, but it would definitely have taken away from the droll toll-booth drudgery that somehow makes the game so interesting.",1,0

It becomes almost impossibly to not assume the life and world presented to you within this game. After playing a few runs, I've still only been able to come out with one of twenty possible endings. I'm still going back to find the rest and, though I have to replay some basic gameplay, I'm not overwhelmed or upset with the idea of redoing previous actions.

I liked the fact that there are multiple endings, depending on the decisions you make in-game.

239030,"Papers, Please","One of the most unique games I have played in a long time.  A very easy to learn puzzle game of sorts, where you take the place of an employee at a border checkpoint. There isn't really much actual puzzle solving outside of some 'side quests' that appear throughout the game, you spend most of your time scanning passports and entry slips for discrepencies.  The pacing of the game is excellent, starting you off with just 1 document to look over, but throughout your time spent in Arstotzka regulations will change and your desk will be flooded with papers for each new person you see. The game becomes a race against the clock as you check over stamps and personal information to admit or deny entry without making mistakes. With mistakes come penalties to your daily earnings, which will quickly make it very difficult for you to keep your family safe and healthy.  An interesting story that is changed by a combination between choices you make and your performance definitely adds some serious replay value to this game. You can continue your progress from any point to change decisions and uncover more of the 20 different endings available.  The only complaints I have are the 'upgrades' in the game are poorly executed, there are only 4 total, one even overrides the purpose of another.

239030,"Papers, Please","Before I begin, I should note that my friend named themselves 'kebab.gif', with a Turkish flag as their avatar, in reference to the Turkeyball's 'Cannot remove kebab!'.  This game also takes place in a parody of 1980s Eastern Europe.  So now to begin.  Typical day passing papers in glorious Artsotzka, denying feces out of everyone. Cloudy weather as usual. Citations left and right. Oops, I let possible smuggler through.  The possible smuggler starts walking towards the checkpoint guards. Suddenly, he pulls his jacket to reveal a suicide vest! 'FOR KOLECHIA!', he screams. He explodes, all three guards die. Crowd is running away screaming.  And as this happens, I see on the top left of the screen, a Steam notification...

239030,"Papers, Please","Lucas Pope has quckly become for me a dev who is the king of simple games that get really hard as you go. Papers Please at first seems like a really boring game at first. You sit at the border of two ficticious countries, deciding who can get in and who can't. The fun comes from the unique controls and the hidden storylines that emerge as you play.   The gameplay is simple throughout the whole game but gets increasingly difficult as you play. You are in charge of the Grestin Checkpoint of Arstotzka. You do this by clicking and dragging the many items you are in charge of. Your first day is very easy: only let people with Arstotzka passports in, everyone else must be denied. Of course you could let anyone in with a dock in pay. You can let anyone in on the second day as long as their passports aren't expired. The whole point of the game is to follow the rules. It's easy to look at them in the first page of your handbook, but making sure all the conditions for entry, especially in the later part of the game, is difficult.  As far as those hidden storylines go, you are also in charge of getting paid enough money to feed and warm your family. There's also some people who want you do do things that might be unsavory to the dilligent border officer, from accepting bribes to be let in without a passport, to corrupt governments and a rebelious cult. All these elements mix together to add up to over ten different endings. It is possible to get through the whole game without getting a paper check wrong, you can do so poorly that you starve your family to death, you can help corrupt people, or have them taken care of. The choice is yours...  In short, the satisfying and simple controls to a complicated and dynamic pixel world make for a fun and stressful game.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a fantastic little indie game set in a fictional Eastern European country called Arstotzka in the fall of 1982. You play as an Immigration Officer at a check point into Arstotzka. The gameplay compromises checking passports and other required documentation in determining if they can enter the country. Even though the game play sounds simple, it very quickly becomes complicated by adding more and more rules and requirements to allow people entry. Depending on how you play, how well you play, and which story line you follow, the game offers a variety of endings. If you can get past having to stamp passports for gameplay, Papers, Please offers a great gaming experience.",1,0

Then it was on sale one day, so I decided what the heck, I'll try it.  It's a hit. It may not seem like much, but sometimes its hard to stop. 'Just one more day, or maybe naw...' I thought there wasn't a story mode but that's all there is at first. The policies and documents get compounded further and further as relations between the fictional country of Arstotzka and the other nations of the Seven Member Forum slowly deteriorate. The game is relatively open-ended. There are TWENTY possible endings (most of which involve the player getting arrested, but hey, do your job and you've got nothing to fear). There is a degree of suspense too.  Sometimes my siblings watch me play it. And when I told them it was available on the iPad as well, my brother wasted no time buying it for himself. Everyone loves playing it.  Great for all types of players.  Story mode of 31 playable days, 20 possible endings, achievements and an unlockable ENDLESS mode. I highly recommend this game",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","My parents came to America from Cuba as children back in the 1960's, so we talk about Communism a lot. One particular story my mom brings up is how she had a brand new story book that my grandfather bought her to read as entertainment on the long plane ride and a watch to keep as a memento of her country she was now abandoning. The customs official confiscated both FOR THE REVOLUTION!!! and let them leave with only one suitcase each. It was weird playing that jerk for this game, but my family said the atmosphere was correct. They were just confused how this is a game about people going IN to a Communist country instead of breaking down the door to get OUT! Enough personal stuff, to the game itself.  Positive: -Suprising amount of choice in the game. Are you a corrupt official taking bribes from criminals and terrorists? Are you a noble patriot helping refugees and resistance fighters? Or are you souless automaton only following regulations? -Good replay value with lots of endings except they can be boiled down to just being variations of Three major endings. -The game is hard in a good way. Gets your brain working overdrive as you have check every tiny detail of multiple documents in only 10 seconds. -The atmosphere of oppression is well made with dark depressing colors and communist iconagraphy.  Negative: -The story is a little thin, but I think they squeezed out as much as they could given the game's structure. -Some people might be turned off by the graphics, but its reasonable given the price range.",1,0

I laughed out loud when they set a key on your desk and instructed you on how to use a gun. You start out simply stamping papers and all of a sudden you're on the front lines of their counter-terrorism operation.

The world painted in this game is bleak and fearful, the more I allowed myself to be immersed in the narrative the more compelled and conflicted I become.   Visually and audibly the game is simple, I find this adds to the bleak vision being crafted by the creator, amplifying the horrible nature of the world in which I was interacting.   The game is simply so consistent in its approach and delivery that it breaks down many modern preconceived expectations for videogames and delivers what makes a good game great, an experience that effects the player, possibly at a core value level.

The game manages to turn a seemingly dull concept into an interesting and poignant one.  The retro graphics somehow don't seem out of place and along with the music create a bleakness in keeping with a red army state behind the former iron curtain, and the game survives this as the focus is on the gameplay.  Checking passports! No fancy scenery needed.  You feel pressurized to get people moving through the queue and stamped in. You feel pressurized to avoid making mistakes. You feel pressurized to keep your family alive and maybe get out of this craphole situation. Damn... was that woman really a bloke?

239030,"Papers, Please","Paper's Please is one of those rare games that you don't really even consider to be that amazing or even enjoyable at first glance. However, once you put in your first hour into the game, you begin to realize the big picture.   In Paper's Please, you enter the job as an immigration inspector and you have to regulate who enters the country of Arstotzka and who doesn't, all while trying to barely earn enough money to keep your family alive. This may sound stupidly boring but the game begins to question you as a person as you make choices on whether or not to help the people how enter your booth. Do you choose to help out a married couple by letting both the husband and wife into the country, despite the fact that if you let the wife in with her inaccurate documentation, you will receive a citation, causing you to possibly lose money, the money that you now need to buy your ill son the medicine he needs to get better? That's one example of a choice your going to have to make. This game, of course, has you checking the documentation of those who wish to enter Arstotzka. The process itself starts off simple, but more layers get added to the inspection process as time passes while you play. This requires you to think fast, as only if you correctly approve or deny any visitors will you actually receive the money that you need to keep you family alive. If you incorrectly approve or deny, you'll receive a citation noting the mistakes you made along with how much money you are being penalized with as you rush to make enough money to last until tomorrow before the clock strikes six and you are done with your work for the day.  If you are someone who would enjoy or finds interest in a game where you have to think fast, but without all of the typical action sequences you would get in something like you would see in something like counter strike or would like to play a game that will bring out your inner morals, then I highly recommend you pick this up as I'm sure you'll enjoy the games complex nature and 20 different endings.

239030,"Papers, Please","Who knew a realistic bureaucracy simulator could be so fun. In “Papers, Please” you play an immigration officer in a fake communist country in 1982. You stamp passports, ask for documents, and check every detail from the dates on forms, to the height and weight of the person. The game gets progressively harder adding more details to cross-reference. The person might look a bit different from their passport photo so you fingerprint them and compare it to their record, or if the person’s stated gender doesn't match their appearance you take a scan of them and check their junk. But the best part of the game is the hard moral choices you have to make along the way. You have a family and have to pay for things like rent, heat, food, and medicine. You earn money for each passport you approve or deny but get fined if you make more than 2 mistakes per day. If you suck you might have to take kickbacks form the guards, or even take bribes from terrorist, just to feed your family. If you’re good you can afford to give your kid a gift for Christmas or even move into a better apartment. This game is truly brilliant. It takes what sounds like the worst premise for a game and turns it into one of the most well-executed and bizarrely addictive games I've played in a long time.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Imagine you’re living under a communist regime, in the early 80s, and working at a border checkpoint where you verify the credentials of people wishing to enter the country. The ministry for which you work passes down various orders and new requirements for entry-approval. Your workload increases with each new edict. The amount of information you’re required to verify borders on the absurd. Make more than a couple mistakes and your wages are penalized (and it’s very easy to make mistakes). It becomes increasingly harder to provide for your family because your salary is docked to depletion. And because it’s so hard to earn money legally, bribes and trafficking start to look attractive.   I’ve just described the game Papers, Please to you. You’re thinking, “that sounds incredibly boring. Stressful, even.” Yet, somehow, I found it be one of the most fun gaming experiences I’ve had in recent memory (and I’m not alone).  At its most basic, the game works like this: Person enters your booth. You inspect their credentials (passports, permits, etc.). You either approve or deny them entry. They leave. The next person enters. Repeat.  There are, of course, other gameplay and story elements littered throughout, but that’s the gist.  It’s set in the fictional country of Arstotzka, just after a war with neighboring country Kolechia. The major city that sits on this border, Grestin, has been divided for some time, and the border is finally open once more. It’s your job to inspect those seeking entry.  The design of the game screen is deceptively elegant. Your workstation manages to be both streamlined and inefficient. I found myself, at times, intensely frustrated that I couldn’t move people through faster. And that somehow added to the enjoyment. The recognition of that frustration intensifies the feeling that you’re some lowly border clerk being asked to do a job that no one could do well.   And when you do get the hang of that workstation, you can make it sing. I learned to immediately place documents where I needed them, readying my cursor for a printout of some supplemental material or other, developing a workflow that would identify elements that were easily verified before moving on to the items that were buried deeper in the documents. It was incredibly rewarding once you could get people flying through that booth.  And no matter which way you choose to play the game, it’s fun. When you adhere completely to the rules, denying entry often, ignoring pleas from the destitute and hard-luck cases there’s a (sick?) satisfaction in keeping Arstotzka “safe.” On the flip side when you do all you can to help those in need, often sacrificing your job and livelihood, the game becomes even more fun and rewarding.  The art is suitably grim and lo-fi, complementing the dystopic nature of Arstotzka perfectly. Everyone is unattractive and sad. The design of the documents feels authentic and plays a key role in identifying forgeries and the like.  The absolute best part of the game is the sound design. Every little mechanical click, punch, and stamp is weirdly satisfying. The strange gibberish used in place of dialog feels impersonal and emotionless (as it should). It greatly enhances the gameplay experience.  Papers, Please is self-described as a dystopic document thriller. And it totally makes good on that promise.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","One of the most impressively atmospheric games I've ever played, definitely noticeable for its apparent simplicity. Arstotzka feels like a real place, all gritty concrete buildings and cold wind, and until you get good at your job it is worrying having to provide for your family.

But if they talk to you much that means you could get a badge out of it. The badge gives you a acheivement and that's it.   Fun but way too easy. Give your family heat one night, and food the next. Every 3 days or so you have to get medicine for you'r son since he is a little ♥♥♥♥♥. Only costs 5 dollars though, and food is like 20 so it doesn't matter. Take bribes whenever you can since there is no penalty for it. And detain everyone none-stop (like 5 bucks for everyone you put in jail).  Oh, and you can detain people in this game. Did I mention that? Well it becomes a little rediculous when you detain people for calling you a ♥♥♥♥♥. Or for demanding to be paid when you brake their watch.

Your family is relying on you for income, and it's up to you to provide for them, or not? Tell them to fend for themselves, shut their heat off, and leave them cold and hungry. If you're good enough, you can even upgrade your dwelling to a much higher class. Maybe one more fitting of an upstanding citizen such as yourself.   Arstotzka depends on you to keep the riff-raff out. Better get to it.  Bonus: This game fights Alzheimer's disease. (not proven) ;P",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a masterpiece. Intuitive, tense, flow-inducing, yet deep and varied gameplay, perfectly contextualized to expose the subtext of its mechanics. Every interaction is both a skill-testing challenge and a moral expression that contributes to a simultaneously emergent and crafted, branching narrative, achieved through precisely modulated procedural generation. This game is meaningful, resonant, and features more cohesive, focused integration of story into gameplay and vice versa than I have ever seen. That it was a low-budget, one-man operation merely makes the state of AAA games all the more shameful by comparison.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Great game, one of the more fun games I have played recently. The simple art style works great and adds to the dark feeling of the game. While the gameplay is pretty simple, it stays interesting by constantly changing and adding rules.  Even though the title screen theme is pretty cool, the game lacks music during the levels. I also found it hard to play for hours on end, it's more of a play for 40 minutes and then do something else kind of game.  Still; 9.5/10",1,0

One of my most memrable momnets:  A man comes up with his passport and papers and i approve him after im done checking, but then he says: 'Please be nice to my wife up next, i beg you' So his wife comes up and gives papers, and everything seems fine until i see an out of date passport and say: 'This passport is out of date.'

239030,"Papers, Please","Absolutely loved it! It's very easy to understand how it works and the pace of difficulty is good enough for you to get into it. However, it IS difficult to master. You really, really need to have a good eye because later on there will be so much documents and rules to take care of. It can get pretty dark as well. Not only do you need to do your job well (I know, I'm shocked too) but you also have to take care of your family. Guess what? I wasn't good enough on my first playthrough and all of my family died because I couldn't afford to pay the bills as well as the medicine and food for them.    It also deals with terrorists attacks as well as other government issues that will test your morality. And yet, it's a lot of fun and addictive. The screenshots may intimidate you but trust me, you will get the flow of the game rather easy. You just need to have great, and I mean GREAT attention to details in order to stop bad people from going through.   The price could be discussed but on the other hand it does offer a lot of depth and strategy. If you're reticent about it, grab it on sale like I did. It's worth it. Trust me, I'm an actor.",1,0

It may seem like there is not much to the game, but the story makes the whole game realistic with terrorist attacks, secret groups of people to take down countries, and checkups from authorities that don't trust you at all. Not only is the story really good, the gameplay balances the whole game out. It gets so overwhelming trying to keep up with all the new rules, all the attacks, and the lack of trust, that if the art style was different, it would feel like i was right in the game.

WELL THEN YOU'RE IN LUCK!!!!  This game is a true exploration of what a video game can achieve. Video games aren't all about fantasy, war, dragons, magic and monsters. Papers, Please proves that this medium is limitless. In Papers, Please, you are put in the shoes of a border control agent in the fictional soviet country of Arstotzka, where you are charged with either allowing or denying access of your great country to foreigners and citizens alike, based on an ever-shifting policy handed down to you each morning. You must check backgrounds, passoports, work visas, and make sure everything matches up. But be quick, because you only have so many hours a day and you get paid per customer, and if you try to rush it, you might mess up and cause the poor woman who came through before to be murdered by the man you should have just denied access...

It's a game where you, besides the occasional bug, can only blame yourself when you make a mistake.  And for a game with such a simple concept, it has the added bonus of giving you moral dilemmas. You have the power to reunite families and save lives, at the expense of your own family. Or do you do your job to a T, relentless following the rules of the Soviet-esque regime you live under?

239030,"Papers, Please","I rate the game Papers Please 4/5. Good.  If you can get past this game's terrible graphics and ugly colors it's actually pretty fun considering this is essentially a game that revolves around following bureaucratic procedures, comparing codes and other information between different simulated pieces of paper, doing other simulated paperwork and stamping people's simulated passports (and doing all this as quickly as possible and learning how that usually isn't fast enough).   The game has a good, detailed story mode plot and can end with any one of 20 different possible endings. This game (and its plot) appears to be heavily influenced by George Orwell but is also influenced heavily (as George Orwell was also heavily influenced) by Soviet Russia and its various border states. This game (which starts simple but becomes increasingly complex) is also often funny but in a very dry and tragic manner. For added replayability it also has two difficulty modes (one mode causes your character to be paid adequately while the other difficulty mode gives you inadequate pay). The amount of money you make affects your family who must be kept warm and be fed and if they are not, will suffer and die (in a sort of oregon trail style menu which says how poorly they are doing).   Ultimately, this is a desktop game which can be quickly opened and closed like a round of solitaire which tests your gameplay ethics in a situation which is, to say the least, full of ethical uncertainty and injustice. The biggest downside to this game is that it can get boring pretty fast (the ugly colors, the ugly graphics the 1 piece of music the game has, the paper-shuffling gameplay all contribute to this) requiring a break from it now and then. This is still a good game if played for short durations and a nice reminder of how bad it can be (even (if not especially) if you really try hard to be upstanding citizen) in a soviet-fascist styled nation-state. And it has dry humor. Don't forget the dry humor because that's a whole lot of what makes this game as good as it is. That and the really cheap price. No bugs.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Glory to Arstotzka. Papers please is a basic game about a Russian ripoff dictatorship and how they have made you play the passport checker. You must try to earn enough money to keep your family alive as well as choose who enters the country.  the game seems to be about simple paperwork at first, but soon it becomes enthralling as you worry if you can feed your fake family their fake food or if you want to let this poor woman pass without the paperwork so that she can see her long lost son or something. The game progresses very nicely in difficulty and has such rich lore even though the whole game you sit behind a booth checking if the paperwork is right. There are multiple endings giving the game replay-ability and overall the atmosphere is perfect for the situation. Pros: +well done story telling +simple but meaningful player made choices +proper difficulty inclination +wonderfully depressing atmosphere +Jorji +0 micro transactions or dlc to speak of  +very low computer requirements Cons: -can get repetitive in endless mode -could use more depth into other countries -passport pictures are hard to compare to faces  fun fact: Arstotzka's soccer team is called the Arskickers",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","For me, buying this game was based on having watched someone else play it, and I thought I could do better. So I bought it, and discovered that this game took something that is probably mind numbing and made it something fun. What you do is look through the documents presented by every immigrant. If everything is in order, you can pass them through the checkpoint. If something is wrong, they either go back to where they came from, or find how comfortable a jail cell is. In my opinion, endless mode is where you really want to play the game if you like it. 8/10",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","An immersive look at the life of a customs agent working for a totalitarian regime, though with only enough content for one look.  Stand Out Features: Hot rubber stamping action.  Pros: Decision points in the game mesh well with the overarching mechanics to drive home the sensation of being an overworked, underpaid, and overall terrified agent. Writing has a good mix of humor and humanity. Multiple endings based on performance and choices.  Cons: The actual gameplay gets stale after a while. Decision trees do not change unless you follow previously unexplored branches (you'll get the same decision points on the same days). Most of the memorable moments of the game come from 'gotcha' experiences that don't hold nearly as much gravitas after the first playthrough.  Would Recommend To: Gamers looking for a thought provoking or immersive experience who can tolerate some samey gameplay. People looking for about 2-4 hours of a unique gameplay experience.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game makes you feel like a detective. It's almost like L.A. Noir without all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t filler in between detective work. It also has a hint of Oregon Trail, since your family can become sick and hungry and you have to support them so they don't die. It's really rewarding to notice small discrepancies with people's info and deny them access to your country. There are some funny easter eggs, as well as moments that are dead serious. It seems like anything can happen at any moment. Reply value is moderate, things can turn out differently, yet the game always starts the same and it can be annoying re-playing the same stuff to get to something different.   The art style is very nice and makes it possible to spot things you probably wouldn't if it was photo realistic, although it's still a challenge. The small details make this game. For example, people will usually look   slightly  different in their passport pictures than in person. Their hair could be different, the lighting could be off, or they could have recieved a scar.  The main gripe I have however is that $10 is a bit pricey, $5 seems more reasonable. I'd pick it up when it's on sale. The beta however is free and can be downloaded at  http://dukope.com .

239030,"Papers, Please","A 'document simulator.' You review documents of an endless, dreary parade of people trying to enter your crappy country from one of its crappy neighbors, granting or denying entry as you see fit. Some sort of omnipotent oversight system penalizes you for technical mistakes. Or technical *cough*'mistakes,' since that last guy slipped you a $20, causing your finger to slip and hit the wrong button, of course.  An excellent diversion from the usual videogame moral dichotomy of 'to be or not be an (donkey is censored?),' where there's actual difficulty in making a decision. As you're usually some variant of The Chosen One, games have to find a way to let you keep playing even if you prove to be a total (censored, evidently) who no one would ever trust to do anything. As such, you're usually free to be as much of a (censored again) as you'd like, and some characters might scowl at you differently, but otherwise with little or no consequence. Or to chase the carrot-on-a-stick they included to try and get you to  not  do so. In Papers, Please, however, I feel they've done a much better job giving your choices positive  and  negative consequences. Do you help the rebels, knowing it could lead to your imprisonment or death? How about if it can lead to your  family's  imprisonment? Do you let a probably-not-terrorist trying to escape an even worse country in, if it means you can pay rent? Or that it could result in a demerit? Do you let your boss violate the rules he continually berates you with? Do you turn in the guy with forged documents, knowing he's probably harmless? Or just turn him away? How about if the guard promises to pay you for each person you arrest, regardless of guilt?  Most of these are not necessarily  that  questionable, I suppose - it's still just a game, basically restricted to what the designers intended, but it is quite a refreshing change from choosing to kill or save the Little Sisters, or selecting the Paragon or Renegade responses (and usually receiving an obvious tangible benefit, regardless of what Peter Molyneux promised you this time around). It's just pleasant to have a game give you pause for thought, rather than pause to calculate reward. Or figure out which of the things is going to actually make Commander Shepard say what you want him to. But in Papers, Please: Does your family go cold tonight?   Or do they go hungry, instead?",1,0

Until you are sixteen hours in and realise that being a virtual border guard has become a way of life, and you know all Arstotzkan immigration laws off the top of your head. It's fun and simple until you realise that you cross-reference passports with ID supplements with work permits without a second glance. It's fun and simple until you realise you know all issuing cities and can tell a genuine dimplomat stamp from a forgery with the corner of your eye. It's all fun and simple until    they find you helped the rebellion and then kill you.    Glory to Arstotzka!  The Actual Review:  The game is fun and is very easy to become serious about as it progresses. It starts off easily enough, making sure passports aren't expired and they are Arstotzkan citizen, but it becomes much deeper very quickly. I haven't gotten around to playing endless mode, because story is intriguing enough. When you begin, you want to let the poor immigrants in and help the people who need it, but you will not last long playing like this. To keep you and your family alive you need to be logical and uncaring, even to your family. Money is tight as well. My tip is alternate nights with food and heat, and those without.

You'll have to decide and manage betweem food and health, and making sure your family isn't dead by the end.  Gameplay: This is definitely where the game shines. The gameplay is all about understanding what can and cannot go through the border. You'll have to scroll through books and passports to decide if they meet the correct requirements to legally pass, and the pressure is solely on the player. Over time the rules get more strict, and you'll be racing against the clock to make sure you get enough people through (without penalty) to earn some cash. There's a gradual curve, so you shouldn't be too overwhelmed in the beginning, but it can be a real hair-puller by the end when you have dozens of small penalties to find.  Difficulty: As I just said, there is a curve over the course of each level. It'll start with simple tasks such as which countries can go through and which can't, all with their own special emblems to easily differenciate. But, as time goes on, more rules such as work passes and body searches get implemented, and this is where it gets tricky. Every new day you get two warnings for hiccups while working, but after that you get money deducted, and this can be painfully nitpicky. But, with enough focus and a keen eye, this is a really well done mechanic, even for people like myself who don't like playing games under pressure.  Graphics: If it isn't already obvious from my profile picture, I *love* pixel art graphics, and this is no exception. The dull colors and gritty look really show the sort of sad side to this game, and it works beautifully well. Every new citizen is different, and even some continuous characters have a familiar look you'll always remember. So, if the look seems interesting to you, you'll enjoy it no problem.  Score: 4.5/5  In short, if you enjoy really simple ideas like this that ramp up over the course of the game, and are willing to pay attention to play it properly, it is an absolute joy that will be hard to put down.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","The game is a repetitive, clerical game that relies on easy, uncomplicated puzzles. You'd think that would make me dislike it... but I very quickly got caught up in the plot, which seems for the most part to be going on outside of my little booth. The game is unlike any other I've played, and it was weirdly intriguing to play a game in which I'm just some random outsider just trying to get into the 'in' crowd.   Somewhere out there, a revolution is brewing... and the player has almost nothing to do with it. But still, it's exciting, and by the time you start thinking, 'OK, that's enough paperwork...' the game throws another curveball. The only thing that seems under-done is the main character's life outside of work -- there's some peripheral talk of food and health and heat and whatnot, but it's mostly as a lever to give the player incentives to act one way or another. It'd have been nice to get more involved in that side of the story, but it would definitely have taken away from the droll toll-booth drudgery that somehow makes the game so interesting.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a surreal indie game in which you play as a border inspector working for the communist country, Arstotzka. The game is full of gray areas that force the player to make difficult decisions. The 'puzzles' get increasingly difficult as the game progresses, with more and more rules being put in place for you to follow. This game is not perfect by any means, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons.   The game starts with you finding out you had been chosen in the 'lottery,' and that you are now forced to become Arstotzka's border inspector. They had recently opened the border, so crowds of people who want to get in are large and unruly, with instances such as terrorism becoming a somewhat common occurance. Everybody who comes up to you for entrance to Arstotzka has a reason for going there, whether it be work or family. It is up to you to decide if they are fit to enter by checking their passports and other documents to make sure they are not counterfeit or missing completely. If you let someone in who doesn't have the proper documents, you will be penalized. This is where the concept of choice appears, as it is up to you to decide if you want to let the desperate people in even if they are not qualified. No matter your decision, the game makes you feel terrible for what you have done. If you let them go, you lose money that you need to spend on rent and medicine for your sick family, which results in a fail-state if it happens to often. If you deny them, you will have to see their hopes and dreams crushed as they discover they may not see their family again.    The game plays fine, but the repetitive gameplay gets old rather fast, so you will often have to take a break to avoid getting too sick of the game. The puzzles start off easy, but get harder as the game progresses. It is a gentle slope, so you will never feel overwhelmed by the amount of things you have to do. It is worth noting that you will likely have to do a lot of reading in order to fully understand how to play the game, and a perfect run is pretty much impossible. The more people you get through the more money you make, but if you go too fast you may make more mistakes which result in more penalties.   The art style of this game is interesting to say the least. People look deformed and sad, which fits in with the bleak setting of the game. There is nothing noteworthy about the graphics, but the gray and brown color scale of the game portray a perfect atmoshere.   Overall, this is a great game that really makes you wonder about the choices you make. The gameplay is quite repetitive, but the tone and setting of the game seem to always bring you back for more. This is a must buy for fans of surreal, atmospheric games.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I wanted to say that this game is amazing and I would like to thank TotalBiscuit and Gourmet Gaming to introducing this game to me (I don't know why, but I'm always attracted to Indie games).   This game describes life as a Arstotzkan border officer living in the Arstotzkan border town of East Grestin (possibly a reference to East Berlin being in East Germany, a communist country. Being a socialist myself, this game gives a lot of critique to socialist regimes, which I totally disagree about the Berlin Wall, but that's a different story.  The game begins with the Ministry of Information giving you information about your new job as a Arstotzkan border officer. You are told info about your job and what to do (keep in mind, make sure your family is well, it doesn't have to be all of them, but just make sure at least one family member is alive).  The game then starts you off denying all foreigners like Kolechians (damn Kolechian scum), and only approving Arstozkans. Like all games, the game will eventually get difficult along the way and might get slightly frustrating or confusing. The gameplay is amazing and makes doing paperwork a lot more interesting (since it's a game where you do paperwork in the game.)  I would like to end it saying that the game is very interesting and detailed in its atmosphere and almost makes you think in a way (like choosing to either deny or let someone in because of something like a family member dieing or something). I would like to give this game a:  9/10  The game might get frustrating for people (believe me, it happened to me) and might annoy them, but you'll eventually get over it.  GLORY TO ARTOTZKA, COMRADES!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I love this game. I'm a bit anal-retentive about desk organization and paperwork, so this game was a perfect fit. You can follow the rules and have a good experience, but the replayability lies in bending the rules. As a bit of a completionist, I'm always interested in experiencing the different endings, and there are plenty in this game. The games are also short, so it's a good way to kill a half-hour or so at a time. I'm revisiting the game after about a year, and I still find it as enjoyable as the day that I got it.",1,0

The best part? Detaining everyone I could. And the bittersweet hilarity of watching my family die because my job doesn't pay enough to feed them, keep them warm, and provide meds.  Also, screw Kolechia.   It's a great game, but only if you like 'puzzle-esque' games that you can involve yourself in. Put yourself in the character and enjoy the challenge. I love it.",1,0

I played for an entire hour, sometimes even saying,'No sir, this passport is expired,' without realizing that I was not even paying attention to any other thing but the game.

I'd like to say that my biases about judging a book by a cover had been eliminated, but let's be real, they haven't. There are and will continue to be plenty of pixel-art games worth the price of admission, but the subject matter of Papers, Please wasn't immediately exciting.  Papers, Please is as cathartic as it is tense and addicting. Specific elements of the game become almost Pavlovian, and the presentation immediately puts you in the inspectors shoes.

On the surface, it is probably most similar to many 'workplace process simulator' games out there, where the challenge is to, as quickly as possible, accurately step through an increasingly complex procedure. The cognitive workout this game provides is reason enough alone to play it.  But that hardly scratches the surface!

239030,"Papers, Please",Papers Please is one of the most creative and intuitive games I have ever played. The story is really good but not just that but the way the story is told is solid. Most of the story is not told through cutscenes or giant blocks of text but through the gamelay which is how storys in games SHOULD be told. The story also branches off in different parts depending on what you do and there are many different endings you can get. The art of the game is really nice and all the characters in the game are special and unique and help tell the story. The game also has me make tough decisions like do I let this guy go through the checkpoint for 10 extra credits to help feed my family or do I deny him to not risk a citation. To think that this game originated from a Ludem Dare compitition is awesome and im glad the mastermind behind Papers Please Lucus Pope continued to make this game the creation we all love today.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please   is a very unique game. 3909 Studios knows how to make a game about simply manning a checkpoint into questioning the ethics of Arstotska while simultaneously questioning my own morals. Through the game things don't get easier. In fact, its quite the contrary. You'll find yourself getting beat over the head with family needs of food, medicine, and heat. All requiring money to obtain, money you don't have. In the beginning of the game I was just a worker keeping criminals and other evildoers out of my country. Then the rent wages went up, my family was getting sick. I noticed that as time went on I started to get more and more desperate for money, accepting bribes whenever I could. I was slowly becoming the person I was originally supposed to keep out. It may be too repetitive for some, but as for me though, they spiced things up enough for the game to not grow stale.

239030,"Papers, Please","Although $10 is a little pricey for a game that is not very long, it makes you think in a way many games do not.  This full-fledged game should be no surprise to those familiar with Lucas Pope’s work.The free versions found on his website are unique and explore seemingly simple ideas for a greater purpose. For example, the Republica Times game explores the complex notions of the power behind media, government corruption and political unrest. These same themes spread into Papers, Please, which makes it a very powerful experience. It helps to split the screen into an overall border watch view on top, which shows people standing in line, the person approaching the booth and the movements of the guards. It will also show terrorist attacks and where you will go when given the tools needed to sedate (or kill) people rushing the wall.

239030,"Papers, Please","The game is simple: Check people's passports and other papers for irregularities and approve or deny them. The appeal of this game is through the complicated situations it puts you in throughout the storyline. You get more money for letting people through, but any mistakes get you a citation.

239030,"Papers, Please","So far as I know the only game of it's kind. The art style is beautiful, as is the soundtrack. The gameplay is by no means easy. As soon as you think that you have got the hang of all the little details you must check, another is slammed into your face. Do not think for a second that you can be lazy on the job! The game is pretty unforgiving, if you screw up 3 times in 1 day, a fine is coming your way, making the already very small amount of money you have to take care of your home and family even smaller. The story of the game has multiple endings, based on different choices you make from behind the booth. I won't give anything away, but at one point earlier on in the game you are given a legally questionable choice. It is not until much later in the game that the wrong decision comes back and bites you. You have the ability to go back to any day in all of your playtime which proves very useful for the previously mentioned screw ups.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a passport stamping simulator, and much more. The game starts off simple: You play as a passport inspector in a 1984-esque totalitarian country, deciding who to allow into the country, with a single stamp. As the game progresses, more and more odious regulations are added, making your job harder over time. At one point I had to inspect FIVE different documents just to decide whether that 80-year old bearded grandpa was a smuggler or not (he was). Right, and there's rents to pay and family members to feed at the end of each day. Tough choices are to be made every day - detain a poor sod for that extra 5 dollars in bribes, or let your son starve for a day. Fail to earn enough money over time, and your family starves to death and its game over.   The graphics, though rudimentary at first glance, as well as the simple 8-bit music perfectly complement the dystopic atmosphere of the game.  But the beauty of this game lies in its masterful storytelling. Through the stamping of passports and little dialogues between characters, you begin to learn more about the world of the inspector; the stories of the characters that pass through your passport booth (including the likeable/destestable smuggler Mr Jorji), as well as the truth of the country he lives in. Between the geopolitical tensions between Arsotka and its neighbours, the terrifying inspector from the 'Ministry of Information' and a border guard's long-lost love, the game draws you in with its simple, yet riveting storytelling.

The premise of the game seems unfun and simple, check papers and approve or deny them.. But the game cleverly throws more at you each day with events going on that really add to the atmosphere. The game grittily makes you choose between family and doing the right thing, you'll choose family, and feel like trash. 10/10 would dystopian again.",1,0

This is not the game for you.   Day one, you won the lottery! Not the money kind of lottery, you won a job! You get to run the new crossing point into your country! They country has been closed for 6 years from others.(How come we dont have that? Lottery for awesome jobs?)  Anyways. So right away, you feel some really good country pride. Either saying to people 'HEY! WELCOME TO THE COUNTRY MAN! SO HAPPY FOR YOU TO SEE YOUR FAMILY AGAIN AFTER 6 YEARS' or you're yelling at people 'GET THE HELL AWAY FROM MY COUNTRY'   Right when you feel like you're doing a great job, someone got by you and there is a terrorist attack with guns and bombs and you can't help but to feel like it's your fault. I mean, you let them in didnt you? Then there are more terrorist attacks. Then people start trying to get you to join a revolution, and you think hey! Thats something to do if i get bored. You start feeling split between your country and the other people.  Then people start giving you stripper cards. Then Drug money.  Serial Killers. People looking for lost loved ones. Then bribing you to let them through.  And you dont know what to do any more. You have to pick your own side. What should you do?   20 different endings to the game are possible, without having to restart it.  This game had me mad, happy, teary eyed and confused. Everyone should buy this game.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","As many mentioned before, Papers, Please makes a tedious job stamping passports and checking information pretty exciting and addictive. The story is great, it really does feel like you're in a 1980's Soviet Republic struggling to make a living without either being put to death or thrown in jail. The game is not without its comic moments, (i.e. Jorji Costava) which kinda make the game feel even more lifelike. (You can't tell me that there wouldn't be people like Jorji who come through immigration stations like that.) I would heartily recommend Papers, Please to anyone.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is more intense than I thought it would be. Normally, I am not at all a fan of games with pixel graphics and the indie tag, don't judge me, it's just not something I normally tend to enjoy. But hey, I saw a friend of mine who had this game and I was pushed forward to get it during a sale after that; I was not dissapointed.  I would say this game is definetly worth anywhere around £3-4 but the actual pricetag is a bit ridiculous.  Nevertheless, the game itself, it makes you care for your family, want to be able to be good to them and be able to get your kid those crayons he really wants for his birthday! I started the game thinking I'll just go with my personality in this game, everything has to be absolutely legal etc. NOPE! an hour into the game and I'm letting people go through the border with all the drugs they can carry for a small something extra for my missus in my pockets. Yeah, I noticed I would end up needing the bribes, or I just plain disagree with the border laws, so I end up not caring at all about some of them.    Extra lols for the men who come through who have the F gender in their document, and you take their picture and they have boobs and all.... The first tim eit happened I was so confused I just didn't know what to do!   Enough of me blabbing now, I do recommend this game, it is fun if you have quick wits and a quick reading eye. Maybe not so dyslexia friendly I would imagine though",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is amazing, 'nuff said. Sure, many people find it boring, but I find it thrilling. The time constraint of the day keeps the pressure high, and the stakes higher - such as your family and their needs. Also, many different things happen to you, making it even more stressful yet exhilarating. For example, illegal cultists come by and you must decide if you let them in. The player is faced with moral decisions, such as breaking the law to unite a couple, or send one of them to their death. All in all, I'd award this game at least 8 out of 10 points.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Paper's Please showcases the true abilities of a point an click style Indie game.  This game acts as an excellent satire of a Fascist society (obviously hinting to Russia in some areas.) The primary gameplay (stamping people's passports) is rather basic, though important and challenging at times, but the secondary gameplay (using your money on various things, deciding to side with an Anti-Arstotzkan rebel force or not, etc.) is what adds to the interesting story. This game also adds infinite playing options, for those who completed the game with the 'best?' ending.  One aspect that can be monotonous is the primary gameplay (see above), as stamping people's passports can sometimes get boring, but other than that, I would say that this game is worth your money.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an award-winning puzzle game created by indie developer Lucas Pope in 2013. The game takes place in a fictional communist state of Arstotzka in late 1982. You will play as an unnamed border inspector who regulates the border checkpoint in a town called Grestin. What you will do throughout the game is to regulate who can admit and who can't by approving or denying their visas or even detaining them. The goal is to keep you and your family alive.  To approve a visa, you must make sure that there are no discrepancies in the entrants' documents, discrepancies like: expired documents, different ID numbers, and etc. The rules will change from time to time as the game progresses, for example: no entry from certain country, entrants must use certain documents, and etc. There are 31 days or levels in the game, and would take about 4 hours to complete the story mode. There are 13 Steam Achievements for the game, it should take you to finish the story mode at least twice to get them all. There are nudity in the game, so if you don't like it, you can always disable it in the options. Also, fun fact: the names of the entrants are submitted online from people all over the world.

Taking a look at the provided documents by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.

239030,"Papers, Please","I found this game through Jacksepticeye a few weeks ago, and I expected to like it because it challenged my mind more than other games do. All I can really say is this game did not let me down! I got about a third of the citations that he did when I played, but he is lasting longer than I did in his series so far. It is crazy how one slightly different move can change your entire ending. It is great to finally have a game that challenges the mind but can also be enjoyable. How may this be possible, you may ask? You just have to play the game to find out (if you haven't played already)!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","It's funny--in the age of ultra-realistic graphics and sprawling even-the-kitchen-seek AAA titles, the games I remember most are often the games where I can do the least.  Here, you see people at a checkpoint, then try to keep your family fed and warm at home. People might invite you to post-workplace events ranging from the sordid to the friendly, but you don't go there. They might claim to have interesting lives, but you don't know for sure if you're lying. All you know is the documents they have, the stories they tell, and the regulations that dominate everyone's lives.  Strangely enough, I found myself loving this game's side characters, precisely because I had to imagine their lives, and also because their lives are so obviously more interesting than the task of comparing yet another passport number to yet another government-issued ID.   This isn't the most fun of gameplay (though, despite its similarities to a rather sub-par desk job, the gameplay is strangely hypnotic and relaxing.) But it's a fascinating narrative exercise, and experiment in empathy.  I got to the end of the game once after a few hours of gameplay, and I may not re-play it. But I also can't imagine forgetting it. This is an interesting little restrained story of the game.",1,0

The more passports you process, the more money you earn, but the more mistakes you make, the more at risk you are of being fired.

Even if seems repetitive, it didn't felt boring - I even felt kind of fear of another citation, when passed someone and wasn't 100% sure if I didn't miss something - the game is giving that kind of climate!

The interface is rather poor, and the harsh time limit on actions makes learning it an exercise in frustration. No tutorial to speak of. If I wanted to work in an office doing nonsense paperwork, I would (and frequently do). But I am not doing it when my reward for such efforts is to watch my fragile virtual familiy get sick after a day because they get cold and can't be bothered to wear jumpers in the house. And who is in charge of printing all these passports? The amount of genders incorrect on them implies they are either all forgeries, or pointless to start with.

You want to know each of the possible 20 endings after all and find out every little secret the game has.  The atmosphere is also really well done, since you have to make enough money to feed your family, while you only earn money if you don't make any mistakes. At the same time, though, you are on a schedule so you can't take too much time.  All this is reinforced by the simple graphics which suit the game perfectly. And if you completed the story, there still is an endless mode with different features and difficulties, so in my eyes worth the money.  I give a 5/5, 10/10 or 100/100, whatever you prefer.

Cries for the rest of the game.   It's easy for me to get sucked into the gameplay, as you're trying to process as many people and as perfectly possible so you can earn enough to support your family. You'll find your morals being questioned many times throughout the game - a couple wants to escape the horror of their home country together but one of them doesn't have the proper documents?   What do you do?  Deny her and be a dutiful officer of Arstozka in exchange for pathetic wages, but at the expense of a human life and the couple's happiness?

As the checkpoint inspector, it is your duty to approve or deny people based on the documents they have and the details therein.

239030,"Papers, Please","I came into this game with only a little knowledge of how it was going to play. I first found out about the game through one of my favorite Youtubers, OfficialNerdCubed. Immediately after I saw him play it, I went out, got myself a Steam card, then bought Papers, Please. I sat down the next day and decided to play a little bit of it, to see if I like it. Four hours later, my eyes were darting from paper to paper, trying to find the discrepancies, because whenever you let someone into your country, you automatically tense up, and wait to hear that damned printer noise, printing out your 'YOU WERE WRONG' ticket. It's honestly one of the most tense times in any video game I've ever really played. I've seen reviews on this saying 'Oh this is the boring job simulator and is stupid.' To those people, I would simply like to say that you are impatient morons who should really just go back to Call of Duty. There are only two games in the WORLD at the moment that I would consider, near-perfect. Those two games are, the orginal Portal, and Papers, Please. I'm currently only at about 14-15 hours on this game, but I'm soon going to shoot right up in hours played, because I remembered that I had 'Endless mode' unlocked. So, my record is 58 people processed without getting one wrong, and I intend to push that to at least 100. If I had to give this game a traditional score, it would be a 9.8-10. If you take anything at all out of this review, take the fact that it's an incredible, innovative game made by a genius man.

239030,"Papers, Please","A great game with great story that delivers its point well.  Papers, Please is a game where you play the role of a border checkpoint inspector in a Communist dictatorship. It's your job to inspect everybody's paperwork, making sure there are no discrepancies, while dealing with managing family finances and supporting your family of five, dealing with terrorist attacks, a shadowy organization that plans to overthrow the government, and constantly,  CONSTANTLY  changing rules. The game ramps up the paperwork as it goes on, and it gets increasingly difficult to deal with it all, but the skilled will be rewarded with more money to help you live. Additionally, the game puts several different choices to you, all revolving around loyalty to your country, loyalty to yourself, loyalty to said shadowy organization, or loyalty to what's right, and it's up to you to choose what you think is right.

Playing it myself it really was unexpectedly fun! There's much more of a story than you'd expect -- there's even a bit of RP involved, as you get to decide what kind of inspector you'll be -- and I even found myself replaying one day over and over and over and over (etc...) until I finally got the result I wanted (TRUE LOVE CONQUERS ALL!!).   Sadly  Ironically, my IRL job means that I'm actually quite good at the game as well: after my first playthrough I had a citation/error rate of about 11%. My IRL government contracting job asks for not much more than that, only 5% error.  If you're considering the game, I'd certainly give it a gry. And if you're not willing to commit whatever the base price is at the time that you're reading this, then just wait for a sale. But IMO, it's worth it!  GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Games As 'Profound Social Commentary'  As a compelling medium for fundamental changes to the human psyche.   Virtual Reality is here. Occulus Rift. HTC Vive. Playstation VR. They have the potential to immerse human beings in experiences that the vast majority of us will never have. Exploring space. Being a pirate. Destroying the office at work. That's amazing, but the 'vision' and the 'message' of games like Paper's Please, are what truly capitalize on the gaming medium as a tool to make humanity grow for the 'better.'   A 'Masterwork' of game design in my opinion. Taking the premise of being A Border Control Officer/ A Paper Pushing Bureaucrat in a fictional Cold War nation (something seemingly dull beyond measure) and using easy to understand mechanics, the game crafts a poignant and surprisingly moving 'narrative'. Highs and Lows. Triumphs and Failures.   The game is hard, frustratingly so at times, but never as a result of poor game design, rather it is hard because the game simulates the conditions of a 'broken bureaucracy trying to maintain order through oppression, resisted by the people who demand being free, demand being treated as thinking, feeling, valuable human beings'. In the game, you are just a simple Father, trying to take care of his family with grossly insufficient state provided means, but your little actions, your small kindnesses and cruelties, can cast ripples that will change a single life or even a whole society.   I feel...like I have a greater understanding of what it was like live in a society with an authoritarian regime controlling/monitoring/ threatening your life. It is something that I feel an even greater desire to resist than I did before. Freedom is something that every human being truly deserves, and truly needs to thrive and be genuine to what it means to be human.   Paper's Please is a game that uses the gaming medium for its very best purpose, imo : to entertain and use that entertainment for the personal and humanist growth of the player.   $10. 100 MB Download.

It is really the player himself who forges the story of not only his avatar, but of a family but for entire countries. One receives an incredible feeling of responsibility.

Alot more papers to check, handling money problems, eventualy getting caught up in a plot of revolutioners or whatnot. I couldn't drop the game for atleast 6 hours upon starting initialy.  This game is strangely addicting.  I clearly recommend this to anyone. It is not just a game. It is a test of personality.  Gameplay 10/10.

This is one of those niche games that is enjoyable, but little long term playability. I count it almost as a puzzle game. You are timed to see how many people you can appropriately get across the border. Comparing their passports, IDs, and paperwork to your guidelines and their responses.  Fun game for when you want to kill a little time.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Amazing. This game is a tedious yet heart warming yet makes you want to have a heart attack as you wait for a violation. This game takes place in a made up country called Arstotzka, and you are a person pulled in the labor lottery to work at the new border checkpoint. Though at first it seems very simple elements are quickly added to make you decide between speed and quality, and the wrong choice could get you exacuted. Random events happen throughout the pre-made story to make you go against or for your country. Also you meet intresting characters that you see time and time again and make you smile and you are evaluated on how well you do your job, needless to say you will probably be told you are scum several times over each day. There is a struggle that feels almost too real in this game where you are trying to make ends meat, making almost nothing and supporting an entire family on that. There is far more i could say about this but in the almost ten hours i've played already i know this game is like non i've played before. If you like being challenged, experiancing something new, or even deciding who lives or dies. This game is for you. If you want a unique game that will challenge you to add to your library, Welcome To Arstotzka.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Having always wanted to pay for the pleasure of doing menial tasks whilst living under the oppression of an Orwellian state, I went into Papers please with very high hopes.  On starting the game, I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of digits and names that had to be cross-checked and I was enjoyign my first day as a guradian of the Democratic Republic immensely before the day ended and I was forced to return home to my parasitic family. This opened up the second key part of the game, being depressed as loved ones die because you, as sole family provider, were too busy apprehending criminals in the name of mother  Russia  Arstotzka. This in the end turned out to be very useful as one family member dying really frees up funds to pay for medicine or expensive crayon sets and keep the others alive.  As the game went on I found that a significant amount of nothing happened, which really livened up the experience and made me wish that exciting things like dening people entry would happen less frequently, however I then began to see the value of things happening in video games as it helps to compartmentalise the long stretches of enjoyable bureaucracy.  In conclusion, more games need to make me feel completely bored and slightly depressed, then maybe they too could have as much praise as I'm dropping onto Papers Please. Also Papers Please is what we in the industry call 'enjoyable', we also say that it 'contains gameplay' which may sound strange in this day of 10 minute long cutscenes, but surprisingly it actually contributes to the experience if the player is occasionally allowed to take control of the protagonist.  -Glory to Arstotzka  -Your Comrade Delta_Lemon",1,0

The graphics are minimal, but it adds to the game. I liked that the creators kept a old game feel to it. I liked that more and more is added each day in game and you go from a simple accept/deny booth to accept/deny booth with access to guns, detaining, and searching.

239030,"Papers, Please","Working at a job that deals with people's well being can be incredibly taxing. Your decision determines whether their lives continue in bliss or go up in flames. It's hard to stare someone in the face and tell them they are wrong, despite their best efforts. Papers, Please gives you the task of being a border checkpoint agent.  With that comes tasks such as checking passport information and following the rules set out by your company. Should you disregard those rules, you will be penalized and may end up losing your job, family or life. It's a very serious game of give and take with people who are honestly trying their best and others that want to game the system.  Most people will never experience such a scenario in their own lives, but this game truly hits home for those that work in public services. Being a doctor, nurse, clinician, phychologist or any kind of care giver can put an incredible strain on your mind. Maybe you gave the wrong advice, or your administration of medicine was done too early; hell, maybe you just looked at someone wrong.  It's never easy to hear a sob story and then deny someone a basic human right that you take for granted. Denying passports and reading that the person is upset can be stomach turning. You feel desperately bad, even if they should have just followed the rules.  Mixed in with all these moral quandaries is a plot about a corrupt government and a rebel group attempting a coup. You can safely ignore them and still have a satisfying experience, but delving into the complexities of the plot in Papers, Please reveals something interesting; maybe you don't agree with everything.  It's easy to be a dutiful citizen and get nothing in return, accepting that life is ♥♥♥♥ and clocking out for the day. It's difficult to stand up to oppression and change the face of the world. Papers, Please gives you an opportunity to see what that change can do and how you can be the catalyst for a revolution.  Or you can simply do your 9 - 5 job and get a decent paycheck and a nice apartment. The choice is yours, but no choice is easy. Thankfully, your save file can be split into branching paths, allowing you to experience every possible scenario.  The graphical style and music bring home the entire package. It feels oppressive and familiar. It looks like an SNES game, but it feels unique. It sounds like the USA lost the Cold War, but it also shows a country in disarray. It's bleak, but beautiful.  The only flaw would be that the game is a bit short. Also, that branching path system doesn't make all of your choices concrete. Having a system by which one mistake ruins your game would be more in line with the self-reflection the game is pushing on you, but I can understand that it would make the game feel incredibly daunting.  Regardless, Papers, Please is worth a play by anyone interested in a more realistic look at humanity. A job that most people never thought of and will probably never see first-hand. It's truly a modern masterpiece and well worth the $10 asking price.  9/10",1,0

Your main goal is to follow your handbook and accept or deny people coming into Arstotzka, sounds like it would get repeitive or boring right?

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The attention to detail is amazing! There are countless little human touches everywhere whch constantly break up the inhuman levels of paperwork. And even though all you can do is stamp documents, your choices have a real effect on the world around you. People's lives are changed by your stamp, even yours! There are literally dozens of endings that you can get depending on your stamping decisions. The social commentary is also fatnastic, and the moral dilemmas that the game puts you in -with just your stamp- are gut-wrenching! You will never agonize over a piece of paper like you will in Paper's Please, and you will never look at a DHS or customs agent the same way again!

If not, you turn them away or detain them depending on their papers (forgery = detain), and if you make a mistake, you are punished by losing your MONIES!

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please at first seems like one of those web browser games with the simple concept of just getting the highest score you can. It quickly turns into one filled with side stories, and an overall (non linear) arching plot where you decide the fates and futures of yourself, your family and the many different people you meet at your checkpoint. This is also one of the more challenging games out there as you eventually have to balance multiple different types of documents and search them for even more discrepencies with even more availiable tools. (There is an easy mode for those wary of the games initial difficulty level.) That being said, the main draw of this game is how unique it really is and how good the stories in such a simple game can be. I rate it so far the third best game of 2013 behind the likes of The Last of Us and Bioshock: Infinite. Quite good company to be around.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is hilarious, creepy, repetitive, and engaging all at the same time. While its concept of accepting or denying people the right to entire a country may seem boring, or even idiotic to put into a video game, it works! The campaign focuses on paying close attention to detail so you don't earn penalties by admitting fraudulent people, all the while you get paid based on people let in and you're on a timer. Your family and yourself can all die of mutliple causes, and the game ends automatically if you run into debt. Everything is expensive, and the pay is little. The other gamemode, Endless, allows you to repeatedly play the game based on a few parameters, depending on the sub-gamemode that you choose. While the game may get frustrating at times, the frustration has a flappy bird effect, where it just keeps drawing you in to play more. For just $10, this game is a steal.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","8/10: Work loyally as border inspector, decide who may enter glorious homeland or return from whence they came. Survive attacks and thwart smugglers until audit comes at the end of thirty days! Glory to Arstotzka!   This game is heavy. The atmosphere is heavy, with the only music being the deep march of the starting screen. Meanwhile, the graphics, reminiscent of NES graphics and earlier, combine well with the garbled speech that only ever seems to sound like 'gestaht' (gestalt? get out? pretty authoritative and germanic sounding) or 'hayaku' (japanese for faster?). Even the core action is heavy, forcing you to focus on the tedium of finding discrepancies in the paperwork of immigrants lest you return home with less pay for food and heating.   Yet just because it isn't strictly fun in the 'Saints Row' sense of reckless abandon and indulgence, doesn't mean 'Papers, Please' isn't engaging. The stress of living out each day, pulled between the attention of your family, your country, and the enigmatic Order of the EZIC Star. Loyalty has its rewards, but any inkling of seditiouis activity may lead to a most miserable end. Thus, it is up to you who to help, both on an individual level and on society at large.   Personally, I was intrigued by the procedurally generated people interspersed between the scheduled characters. Jorji Costava was undoubtedly the one glimmer of comic relief amongst the procession of separated families and sly smugglers. Right when I saw that passport from 'Cobrastan' I knew he'd be my number one source of warnings, though I thankfully managed to never have pay taken away via excessive citations.  While I generally took pride in getting no citations and returning with plenty for my family, I took exception with truly momentous events, especially since I wanted to get all the foreign coins in one playthrough. In particular, reuniting Sergiu with his love was sweet, and there was a grim satisfaction in going along with the vengeful fathers plan to murder Simon Wens, the man who killed his daughter.   Nonetheless, this is definitely a melancholy game as a whole, and is all the better for it. Rather than the shiny, happy veneer one might find in free to play or corporate games, 'Papers, Please' confronts the anxiety of being an unassuming, yet critical, cog in the machine. Feeling powerless, yet potentially influencing the development of these shifting nations, with you being the decider of who permeates the membrane between them. It's an interesting position to be in, even if the mechanics aren't as exhilirating as one typically expects from a game.",1,0

Aside from learning what its like to protect a border from criminals, this game has a secret or two up its sleeves involving a shady society of rebels. There is also fun funny foreign guy who keeps forging documents in crayons.  In all seriousness, the game is a morality decision simulator. You will encounter all sorts of 'grey areas' during your work. Will you split up a married couple with the wrong forms? Take a bribe to buy your kid medicine?

The aesthetic is simple but fits well with the Soviet-era theme, while the storytelling is absolutely excellent. The brief insights you're given into the various characters you will interact with are well thought out, and serve to push the overall themes of the game.

As the game goes on, the relations between Arstotzka and the other regions change, therefore changing the entry requirements you have to check, making the game challenging every day.  It's a great game, challenging and intriguing.",1,0

After the initial shock wore off I was able to analyze just how the economy is in this Arstotzka place -- it's just about as expensive as 2014 USA; this game managed to be a sneaky commentary, and actually fun to play while it was doing it.

While I disagree with this for the reason that the day that a game is perfect is the day that world peace becomes a reality, I still think that this game deserves all the credit it gets. In the game you are a worker at a boarder checkpoint, but this is covered in the discription so i wont go into much detail. Most of the gameplay consists of managing papers and deciding if all the papers are in order and sending off into the county. It starts off easy but slowly becomes harder as you have to manage up to 15 things to check by end game. I do not want to spoil too much of the endnings as there are 15 i belive, however I encorage you to get this game. It is a look into your own self conscious. Will you listen to the sob story of a random person you have never met and let them in or will you save that five dollars you get for turning her away to buy medicine for your dying son. The choice is yours.

They may not enter Arstotzka, and even better, if they try to pass through, they can say bye to their passports because they have been claimed by our Glorious Leader.  In this game, we have this job, wait, no... we have this honor of protecting our glorious country from unwanted degenerates. We are faced with unworthy liars and traitors who are only out to undermine the beauty of Arstotzka. They will try to have you join 'their cause', but their cause is something cannot be trusted. All of your trust, as is mine, goes to the glorious Arstotzka. Your 'family' (Arstotzka is your family now) may die. My neice ran away and I did not have the money to house her because I wanted new equipment to help me keep Arstotzka safe. Sacrifies will be made. People will die. You may die. Arstotzka lives on.

Personal synopsis: This amazing game is a marvel of simple game-play put to the very best use. Attention to detail is king as you monitor the comings and goings of immigrants, refugees and expatriated rebels in this amazingly addicting game. Unlock time and free mode for a real challenge and see how you rank against the best.

239030,"Papers, Please","I really, really like this game. The first thing that I love about it is the dark, foreign, uncomfortable atmosphere mainly achieved through the art style, dialog and music. At first, reviewing a bunch of papers may sound boring, but it is really well done and it a satisfying experience when you get it right. If you are a meticulous person then I think you will definitely like it.  But the game isn't really about reviewing papers without making any mistakes. It is about the choices you make in this poor, communist, conflicted society. Do you allow an ill woman to pass through the gates without having all the proper papers so that she can receive the treatment that she requires, knowing that you will be punished for it and lose the money you need to feed your starving family with? There are bigger decisions to make out there, and they are all yours to make. They will lead you in one of the twenty endings.  Very refreshing game, highly recommend it!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a fantastic little indie game set in a fictional Eastern European country called Arstotzka in the fall of 1982. You play as an Immigration Officer at a check point into Arstotzka. The gameplay compromises checking passports and other required documentation in determining if they can enter the country. Even though the game play sounds simple, it very quickly becomes complicated by adding more and more rules and requirements to allow people entry. Depending on how you play, how well you play, and which story line you follow, the game offers a variety of endings.

Do you call to your humanity, let them through, and risk your family's welfare and imprisonment? Or do you stamp denied on their passport to their curses and possible future retributions?

239030,"Papers, Please","A true oddball game. Nobody would ever think that making a game about something a dull as checking passports could ever be made into a truly great game like this one manages to be. The story line has many branching points were you are given the choice to support the current weakened communist government or aid the well-meaning but somewhat foolish rebels, all the while deciding what to do with hordes of people seeking a better life in your “glorious” country.   How it handles the actual meat of the game is very well done, starting you off checking passports and adding to that slowly until you are armed with a sniper rifle, forcing people to do strip searches to make sure they aren’t bringing weapons or drugs, checking fingerprints and criminal records, all the while making sure that their passports, work permits, diplomatic papers, immigration pass, vaccination certificates and identity cards are all correct and not forged in any way.

239030,"Papers, Please","Lucas Pope has quckly become for me a dev who is the king of simple games that get really hard as you go. Papers Please at first seems like a really boring game at first. You sit at the border of two ficticious countries, deciding who can get in and who can't. The fun comes from the unique controls and the hidden storylines that emerge as you play.   The gameplay is simple throughout the whole game but gets increasingly difficult as you play. You are in charge of the Grestin Checkpoint of Arstotzka. You do this by clicking and dragging the many items you are in charge of. Your first day is very easy: only let people with Arstotzka passports in, everyone else must be denied. Of course you could let anyone in with a dock in pay. You can let anyone in on the second day as long as their passports aren't expired. The whole point of the game is to follow the rules. It's easy to look at them in the first page of your handbook, but making sure all the conditions for entry, especially in the later part of the game, is difficult.  As far as those hidden storylines go, you are also in charge of getting paid enough money to feed and warm your family. There's also some people who want you do do things that might be unsavory to the dilligent border officer, from accepting bribes to be let in without a passport, to corrupt governments and a rebelious cult. All these elements mix together to add up to over ten different endings. It is possible to get through the whole game without getting a paper check wrong, you can do so poorly that you starve your family to death, you can help corrupt people, or have them taken care of. The choice is yours...  In short, the satisfying and simple controls to a complicated and dynamic pixel world make for a fun and stressful game.",1,0

Do you suck up to your boss and be a stickler for the rules, or you do you try to enjoy your work and bring some humanity to it? It's a game that makes you consider your actions like no game before or since. It will make you feel like a genius....and it will make you feel uncomfortable. And then MORE uncomfortable.

I learn something new with each passing day (each day is a 'level') and if you mess up you can go back to a previous day and start over. For example, I accepted a bribe on day 11 for $1000. A few days later I moved into a nicer apartment. My neighbors reported my 'new wealth' to the athorities and they took my bribe money and are investigating the situation.

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is such a unique experience. Never would I think that this game would be as immersive, interesting and well-thought out as it was. A struggle to support your family, government corruption and an organization that you can choose to help, or carry on with your government job. Tough choices, interesting characters and 20 endings helps push this game's value further. It was surprisingly fun to look over people's passports, entry permits, vaccination documents and work passes to find any discrepancies. I was annoyed at a couple things, however. Why do you recieve citations immediately? It can seem really pointless if the invisible super inspector finds that one error you overlooked, making you wonder why you are there in the first place. It would have been better if it had shown you at the end of the day, perhaps with their name on the citation. Without a doubt my favourite character from all of this is Jorji Costava. This genuinly nice, pleasant guy constantly slips up in one way or another, but will return your friendship. He is a delightfully refreshing character, and he is more than just comic relief.

In fact, this is one of the most interesting months that could happen for your border agent. The plot is wonderfully constructed, with multiple branches and backstories to keep things interesting. Most of the people you file passports for are dull and boring, but there are a few who make it all worth it. The gameplay is surprisingly fun, as I played it as more of a puzzle game, trying to find the one missing piece in that person's data.

239030,"Papers, Please","Glory to Arstotzka! That is the words I felt I have been saying over and over through playing this amazing game. Also DENIED, and a few swear words to vent out my anger.   Papers, Please is a weird game. It is ment to be a passport control simulator, but it delivers as at times, a really challenging game. All your control is the mouse. All you do, it drag stuff and click, but to say the least its not a point and click adventure. Your first day it is simple. Only allow people that are from Arstotzka. Then check all the passports. In the end, you will be checking so many documents, you need to stay on the ball or you will slip up. Massively. I wont be telling anything like said documents, since I dont wish to ruin what is around the corner. The game does have a goal. Do your job. Each person you clear or deny gives your a total of 5 credits. You have to clear enough people to be able to afford food and heating for your family. At times, it is hard. Once, I had to give up food for a day to afford the rent. So what stops you from clearing everybody? Punishments. If fail too many times, you lose your money. That money that will save your family from an early coffin. The problem is, the game can get to you. Occasionly, you will get these people who know they cant get through, but before you tell them to go away, they tell this sad story. Great. Do I seperate the wife from the husband and possibley let her die? Or do I risk it? Nah, it will be fine. The next day, she is in the newspaper. She got murdered. YAY... I feel like sh*t.   I am going to end it on this note. I over the 2013 year, I bought a total of about 70 games. Its my hobby to say the least. I would happy trade them ALL in for this game. Hands down game of the year 2013. I would even say GTA V was worse. If you have the money, just buy it. Why are you still reading, you donkey? GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is fun and honestly proves wrong the recurring myth that better graphics mean a better game. I found more enjoyment playing a pixelated man in a booth, deciding who could cross the border than playing whatever brown, HD mess EA, Activision or anyone else decided to churn out. This game is inexpensive and worth playing over and over, with the game feeling almost like a communist Oregon Trail.  You check passports and identification to make sure people can or can not enter the country, your goal; make money to keep your family alive. It adds a strange balance because you can choose to be cold, calculating and dismissive for the sake of your family and not allow a wife or husband to get through because of improper papers but at the general cost of your humanity (there is no humanity meter, so don't worry about that), the characters have simple designs and yet very rich personalities that make the choices you make feel all the more real and at times all the more jarring.

The brown and gray sludge of repetitively regurgitated FPS titles can stay on the consoles for all they like, PC gaming has Papers, Please",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Surprisingly enjoyable.  First off I enjoy how complex it is. You always have to be on the top of your game, but quick about it. If you make too many mistakes or pass too few people, you won't make enough money to feed your family that week.   I also like how it also allows you to make some moral decisions. Willing to face a penalty to reunite a couple? Stop a criminal? Get an achievement? (Yes to all 3, by the way) It adds a bit more replayability to the game, where I can see what happens if I chose the different option.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an amazing game given the fact that you are doing similar tasks everyday. The style is simple but it still feels real enough that you feel emotion toward some of the people passing through. There are so many different endings and most of the time you do not realize untill after the ending that one certain event caused your demise. That or you ran out of money, your family died, or a terrorist killed you after you failed to shoot him.  The deeper parts of the game are the moral choices you have to make throughout your time at work. Do you join the order? Do you stay loyal to your country? Do you take money that appears to save your dying family or burn it knowing the sender is unknown? Do you cure your sick wife or give the family heat? Or do you skrew everyone and upgrade your booth instead. One slip up, one missed weight or invalid seal, can be the difference between a suicide bomber getting into the country and you saving yourself and the guards.

I like the feeling of monotony in this game as it felt like I'm under a totalitarian government and I like the atmosphere as it perfectly depicts what it feels like to be an immigration officer.

239030,"Papers, Please","As it says 'dystopian document thriller' -- that's right on the money. Well, it should be: it's in the pic.   Anyways, this game is quite unique, atleast to me. It's simple and runs on the slowest of machines. Well, there really isn't much to this game graphically becaure you're reading documents the whole time. I'm a guy who loves some damn good graphics. This game doesn't have it. But that's OK. Why?   Because this game is awesome.   You work at a security checkpoint, and you have to find discrepancies in peoples' documents (passports, ID cards, entry permit, work permits, grants, diplomatic authorization, etc.) to locate criminals or people trying to fool the system to get throught the checkpoint.   Sounds booring but it's not. This game is pretty damn fun because you're working against the clock. Attention to detail and textual discrepancies is key for success in this game.  You'll find at first people successfully tricking you, but learning their tricks and stopping them in the future is pretty satisfieng. Working against the clock, having show much stuff to look out for, and having a family you have to provide money for adds to the intensity.   Overall a sweet game I'd highly recommend.

239030,"Papers, Please","One of the most original games I've played in a long time. You work at border checkpoint in a 1984 stylized world where you examine the paper work of individuals trying to make their way into the country. Its kind of strange to think that looking at paper work can be even remotely fun but when you find that descrepency its incredibly satisfying to deny them entry.   Papers Please has a ton of surprises sprinkled about it and has a very dark humor which does a great job at keeping it entertaining. The story lines throughout your time at the border present someone in your position with some tough choices that can really only happen in a game like this.   One of the side plots had a guy ask me to allow a murderer through the border even if his papers were wrong because the man killed his daughter. He wanted me to let him through so that he can kill him himself later on. But If I were to do that I would get a deduction from my pay which means I might not be able to pay for the medicine my son needs. So you can see this game can be pretty damn dark, and that darkness isn't always accompanied with humor.  There are many more side plots that are best experienced for yourself so I won't say much more but Papers Please is completely original almost to its core and should be played by all.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please delivers a one-two punch of addictive gameplay and moving storyline that's sure to be a knockout. The drab, retro art style creates an oppressive atmosphere that compliments the rushed tedium of the game mechanic. That combination peppered with the huge cast of NPCs ranging from pitiful to hilarious and the hard decisions one must make to keep their family alive is a recipe for deep emotional impact and hours of fun. It is rare for a game to be so addictive on a shallow mechanical level and also have a story as compelling as a good dramatic film. Cart Life awakened that possibility in my mind, but where Cart Life stopped as a beautiful-yet-buggy experiment, Papers Please delivers a polished simulator with a fantastic story and a decent amount of replayability. If you are ready to challenge your memory and observational skills, if you are ready to question your moral compass and empathy, if you are ready to experience the bleak and utter hopelessness of the Arstotskan border and love every minute of it, pick up your 'Approved' stamp and download Papers Please.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","At first it seems like a paperwork simulator with retro art style, but once you get the hang of basic bureaucracy and manage to somehow earn enough money to live past the first couple weeks, the game changes totally. The paperwork you need to do among other tasks increases exponentially, while you get bombarded with terrorist, conspiracies, corruption, terrible human faiths, blatant trolling and good old soviet rifle barrel in your mouth. You'll begin to live as a part of a political satire about cold war era east block. The player is driven to a paranoid husk of a person trying balance between his family's survival and turning into cold heartless machine.  This is not a game about paperwork, it's a sosiological experiment about how much can a person take before caving in under the pressure from the system.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","You have to check the travel papers for everyone wanting to pass the border.. what fun could that be?? Well , try it.. you're not in it for the graphics, but you might find this game worthwhile.. Not worth more than a couple of euros maybe but trying to get as many travelers through before the end of the day can (in a certain mood) be satisfying and even addictive.  So yes, I would recommend although the price is a big factor here.   PS. A big thing to take from several experiences on the internet: 'try the judge the experience on story, rather than just the game machanics'. Personally that would never work for me, but I guess the story is a big thing here when the rest of the game is so simple.. here's my pro-tip: try to look at it like sollitaire or minesweeper on steroids, and you actually have a pretty powerful game here.",1,0

The actual gameplay consists of nothing more but scrutinizing and clicking, but against time and moral constraints you are pressured as a player to make hard choices whether to follow the rules or allow life-altering exceptions, and live the consequences. Far from mind-numbing, Papers, Please requires sharp attention to detail, good memory and organized, quick-thinking.

I suggest it even at full price, the visuals are quite pleasing to look at, the gameplay is surprisingly fun and addictive. It pulls you in and gets you asking yourself 'Why is this so much fun?'.

Though at first it seems very simple elements are quickly added to make you decide between speed and quality, and the wrong choice could get you exacuted. Random events happen throughout the pre-made story to make you go against or for your country. Also you meet intresting characters that you see time and time again and make you smile and you are evaluated on how well you do your job, needless to say you will probably be told you are scum several times over each day. There is a struggle that feels almost too real in this game where you are trying to make ends meat, making almost nothing and supporting an entire family on that.

The gameplay is literally the same as being a border guard. So, if this was labeled 'Border Simulator 1982' it would get a 6 or 7 out of 10. But it's not. The game is constructed in such a way that you want the very damn best for your little border guard and his family. You want to overthrow the corrupt government and you want to do the best damn job at removing Kolechians from the premises you possibly can.  How they did it, I don't know for sure.

In terms of the gameplay I wil admit that the game does not hold your hand at all. I had to find out some things on my own or rather stumble upon them.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please.  A small game set in the fictional Eastern Bloc country of Arstotzka at the end of 1982. You play as 'The Inspector,' an immigration officer charged with running the East Grestin Border Checkpoint on the Arstotzkan border with Kolechia, a neighboring nation that was recently at war with Arstotzka. You must check immigrants' papers for discrepencies like incorrect seals, missing papers, wrong issuing cities, and even one case of a hand-made passport. The setting is dreary, the mood bleak and monotonous, and the gameplay a whole heck of a lot of fun.  Papers, Please is not an average game, as evidenced by the rave reviews found across the gaming media. It's not a shooter, like Halo or Counter Strike. It's not an RPG, like Skyrim or Fallout. It's really not a normal simulation, as it has hardly any comparable mechanics to most sims.  Then again, it has elements of all of these. There are scenes of gun and explosive violence, the strain of having to keep your family alive and safe, moral dilemmas when an immigrant is missing papers but gives a touching story, and - of course - the constant clicking and scanning of documents while doing your duty as Arstotzkan Immigration officer.  Personally, I would recommend this game more than once if I could here. Papers, Please isn't for everyone, especially those who rather action-packed games with little thought. However, considering how story has developed in video games over the past forty years, I think these people are growing thinner in numbers.  But, yes. I recommend Papers, Please.

239030,"Papers, Please","This may have been the most unique game I played this year. In Papers, Please, you play a immigration clerk screening immigrants for potential entry into the fictitious country of Arstotzka. Immigrants give you their paperwork and it’s up to you to process and find any discrepancies in their papers.   At the end of the day you’ll have to choose how to spend your very small paycheck - on feeding your family, paying the heat bill, or providing your children their medicine. And you probably won’t have enough money for all of it. You’ll want to process as many immigrants as you can as quickly as possible, because you’re paid by how many you process per day. But you don’t want to go too fast or you may miss a discrepancy in their paperwork and have to pay a fine. It’s kind of a nerve wracking and depressing game to play. But I don’t mean that as a negative criticism of the game, it was clearly designed to invoke those kinds of emotions. You really get the feeling of what it’s like to be a desk clerk doing a menial but stressful job and getting paid next to nothing for it.   It’s an interesting and unique indie game.

It appeals to a very specific kind of player, in a very rich rewarding way.  The game challenges the player to go to the same office (same screen), and encounter a routine job that requires the player to balance their character's needs, with doing a great job that requires a GREAT deal of attention to detail. This is a game of bureaucratical paper-work and power to change the lives of hundreds of little people. One of the great things about this game is how it gives us a glimpse into the complexities of the old cold-war countries and their struggles with challenges to their way of life, but not as most games where you are an all-powerful head of state, but as a lowly appointed officer, just doing their beurocratical job, a job at the border.",1,0

With the challenge escalating from mere passport differences, all the way to checking that countless amounts of information all match, whilst under a time limit that makes you want to squeeze as many checks through as possible to earn more money for your starving family, this game is a true brain buster.  Aswell as straining memorisation, the gamer is required to make constant moral choices, which are even harder to make when the choices could compramise your job, thus starving your family or risking letting an illegal through so they can see their loved ones. Or money being so tight that you have to choose between heating for the night or food, or medicine for your family, or do you try and improve your booth at work in the hope to help earn cash faster? But with so many choices and endings that can occur at the end of almost any level, this gives the game GREAT replayability, with 20 endings, I not only want to keep my game going the longest, but after I want to discover the other, shorter endings too. The graphics work great with the gameplay and infact aid the gamer and help making identifying certain NPC's alot easier than say if the game was next gen graphics.  I definitely recommend this game for those looking for a brain teaser or just something a different, but for me getting this at like £3.50 is a steal, hours and hours worth of gaming here, and I look forward to playing the 'Endless' mode to see how far I can go till my head explodes.  8/10 Sometimes I was stuck on how to do certain things due to a slight lack of explanation, and the game has a tiny issue of repetition, but it's of course bound to be.",1,0

It requires extreme attention to detail in which you inspect documents, compare people to their documents, and deal with every changing rules that are dictated by events that happen in the game. I truly felt sympathy for border control inspectors after playing and will likely be a little less impatient on my next international trip.",1,0

Every tiny detail can trip you up, so if you have a touch of OCD to you, this may be something you'll enjoy. For me, it gives me flashbacks to carding people for alcohol, but at least in this game they don't stick around and complain at you when you deny them. Story mode can be unforgiving of mistakes if you want to look over a few discrepancies for the sake of morality, so you may want to re-play levels to get a better understanding of the details before you move on.",1,0

Between the sob stories and power surge that the controller (player) has to face at the cost of the witty travelers, there is a subtle humor that can completely catch you off guard. This game has it all: finger prints, tickets, guns, grenades, and reoccurring characters. You are the controller and your foes are the documents. Use your keen eye to filter through what pile of documents match and which are fake. The comments that the travelers make may outsmart you, but do not let their wit beat yours.

This game doesn't have it. But that's OK. Why?   Because this game is awesome.   You work at a security checkpoint, and you have to find discrepancies in peoples' documents (passports, ID cards, entry permit, work permits, grants, diplomatic authorization, etc.) to locate criminals or people trying to fool the system to get throught the checkpoint.   Sounds booring but it's not. This game is pretty damn fun because you're working against the clock. Attention to detail and textual discrepancies is key for success in this game.  You'll find at first people successfully tricking you, but learning their tricks and stopping them in the future is pretty satisfieng.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' provides players with the most unique gaming experience since the launch of the PC Minecraft beta. Fascinatingly different, and surprisingly intense, 'Papers, Please' entertains in a way most games fail to even come close toward.   Simple, yet challenging, this game offers tons of replay value with new elements of gameplay being brought into the game constantly. Dark, mature and enriching, the cold war esque feel of the game is riveting and depressing. A fair amount of memorable characters make their way into a simple yet endeering plot that will captivate you. Elements of survival also help keep the tension high as the life of your family and those around you are threatened through various forces.  'Papers, Please' is unique, refreshing, grim and wonderfully cruel. You'll question your own morals as you are forced to hold the lives of strangers in your hand. Easily one of the best games of 2013. Wildly underappreciated.  My rating: A  Buy it now while it is cheap on Steam. Easily worth $4.99, or even the full price of $9.99",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","(This review was originally posted at  http://www.gearboxunion.com/2/post/2014/03/mqc-4-papers-please.html , check it out for pictures and more!)  As children we have all dreamt of becoming cowboys, doctors, and astronauts. One thing that no child has ever picked as their dream job though is a paper pushing government bureaucrat. So you'd think a game based on checking over documents and proof reading information would be a massive failure. Turns out it's oddly incredibly entertaining and rewarding. Let me introduce you to 'Papers, Please' where you play the role of an immigration inspector at the newly opened border of Arstotzka, a fictitious dystopian Soviet Union-like communist state at the end of a 6 year war with their neighbor/rival Kolechia.  Also it's pretty apparent that you'll be shot as a traitor if you smile in this country.  The basic gameplay mechanics are as simple as they sound, checking paperwork for errors. I know it sounds boring, but stay with me. It starts you out checking expiration dates, then slowly adding more and more little bit of information that need looked over. Examples include making sure all the required documents are accounted for, spotting counterfeit seals, performing strip searches to find drugs/weapons, detaining suspicious persons, and following protocols during terrorist attacks.  You have to pay close attention though because round to round (or 'days' as the game calls them) everything can change. Someone that was denied entry into the country one day could be allowed in the next. Or vice versa. Or shot on sight. It's like a communist version of the old handheld Simon game, checking/filing/stamping in an escalating rhythm trying not to miss a beat.  Oddly it soon it becomes second nature checking all the details. Something that gives you such a sense of accomplishment when you ferret out violations so you can give the big fat red stamp of doom/call the guards over to detain them.  If you do make mistakes though, whether by letting through someone ya shouldn't have or denying someone ya should have, your pay starts to get docked after the the first two errors of the day (you only just not get paid for them). It adds a sense of stress to checking every number and letter of the documents. But it's a good kind of stress, the motivating kind.   What also adds to the pressure is that the pay you are receiving is not just some score. It's what you use to keep your virtual family alive, healthy, and warm. If your performance takes a hit, it's your family that suffers.  That being said though, where the game really comes alive is with the stories that play out in your tiny border box. The wife with out of date paperwork pleading with you to let her through. The guards asking you for favors. Lost lovers finding each other. Officials offering bribes for you to look the other way. Terrorists/freedom fighters looking to you to aid their cause. And how it all builds around these simple game mechanics.  Do you play things completely by the book, heartlessly denying any lost soul that begs you for help? Or do you use your place of power to under mind the oppressive government that gave it to you in the first place? Or somewhere grey in between? There are 20 different endings to the game based off of the choices you make through the levels.  The game is dripping in charm and gets it's hooks into quickly, so I fully endorse getting it. You will not be disappointed at all.",1,0

Half the fun of this game is that you get the privilege of being a cold callous bureaucrat, a corrupt official with his finger in every illicit pie. For a change, you get to be the one giving everyone the business and not the one looking down the business end of such and such thing!   You can also be kind and benevolent and let every person through who has a sob story. Just know, that no matter how you choose to play this game, you (your character, not 'you' yourself) are the most miserable scum of the earth and you're damn lucky to have a job!     I will not lie, there are a few bad things about this game. You need to remember/learn a set of arbitrary rules that are subject to change at the drop of a hat. You're pinned to a small desk where important things are sometimes hidden below unimportant things. You might have to read the newspaper! You might have to see something that you cannot unsee. Anything helpful to you is in a book that you might have to read more than once. All of these qualities make this game confusing but at the same time real. If any of this sounds like too much work, I feel sorry for you. Unless you're some kind of movie star, you should already be used to this sh*t by now.   If I haven't listed everything awesome about this game, it's because I only meant to relate half of what's so good about it; the other half you must discover for yourself. Also, it's $9.99!

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please at first seems like one of those web browser games with the simple concept of just getting the highest score you can. It quickly turns into one filled with side stories, and an overall (non linear) arching plot where you decide the fates and futures of yourself, your family and the many different people you meet at your checkpoint. This is also one of the more challenging games out there as you eventually have to balance multiple different types of documents and search them for even more discrepencies with even more availiable tools. (There is an easy mode for those wary of the games initial difficulty level.) That being said, the main draw of this game is how unique it really is and how good the stories in such a simple game can be. I rate it so far the third best game of 2013 behind the likes of The Last of Us and Bioshock: Infinite. Quite good company to be around.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is hilarious, creepy, repetitive, and engaging all at the same time. While its concept of accepting or denying people the right to entire a country may seem boring, or even idiotic to put into a video game, it works! The campaign focuses on paying close attention to detail so you don't earn penalties by admitting fraudulent people, all the while you get paid based on people let in and you're on a timer. Your family and yourself can all die of mutliple causes, and the game ends automatically if you run into debt. Everything is expensive, and the pay is little. The other gamemode, Endless, allows you to repeatedly play the game based on a few parameters, depending on the sub-gamemode that you choose. While the game may get frustrating at times, the frustration has a flappy bird effect, where it just keeps drawing you in to play more. For just $10, this game is a steal.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a fantastically unique game, that essentially is a fast-paced, highly detailed, border control rpg. You play as a border guard person for the arstotzkan borders, and you are paid quite lowly for this high stress job. while the game might start out nice and easy checking a couple of things, it picks up pace fast, where you will soon find that you have3 or 4 documents to check each with it's own fine list of details to check for. Now if you had the time to check everything at your own pace this would be quite an easy game, but you have a family to take care of, and at 6 o'clock the border closes and you finish up who ever you are attending to and go home.   The plot of this game is very dynamic as in, you make choices, and the choices you make will reward you with money and tokens and sometimes just the feeling of knowing you helped someone in need, while at the same time fining you and causing chaos that cuts the day short, making you miss out on some of the prospective cash you could have earned.  Never the less, this game is intense, rewarding, and has a very good feel to it that makes it so enjoyable to play. It is an experience that is very much worth while, and enjoyable.",1,0

Well when you're faced with terrorists, underground organisations, smugglers, lovers, families, corrput police officers, bribary and many more outlandish situations, a day at work is never, ever dull!   Should you sell a digital watch to someone in line to pay for you son's birthday present, or return it to the man who trusted it in your care? Should you be slack with a regular? Should you let someone through the border because a friend asked you to? All of these questions run through your head with evey new person you meet, and all the while, your family back in your apartment are starving, freezing and suffering from sickness... And every major choice you make, the world around you changes, as the daily newspaper will let you know..

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' deserves its reputation for excellence. I played it first in Beta, and had already clocked up hours of play before the final product arrived on Steam. Most games give the player power - over a gun, or a car, or a team of small and aggressive monsters - but few provide the sort of authority that comes with the 'thunk' of a rubber stamp at the Arstoktzka border checkpoint. How the player uses that authority is at the heart of the game, and poses some difficult questions about freedom of choice, human rights, individual responsibility and collective security. Do you take a bribe to feed your family? Put your neck on the line to reunite someone else's? Detain a minor offender for a healthy kickback? The choices don't seem as clear-cut when you're sitting in that box, and that's the genius of the game: the choices become important. Out of very basic mechanics comes a believable world, and it's absolutely beautiful in all its depressing, overbearing glory.  You may find yourself regretting your actions, or quietly justifying them to yourself. You may frighten yourself with the ease with which you can have a person marched away, saving yourself the paperwork of processing them and earning a little pocket money to boot. By the latter half of the story, turning an applicant away over a slight clerical error saves a hell of a lot of checking, and they might hate you for it but you've got a deadline and mouths to feed. And besides, it can't be as bad as the terrifying 'rat-tat-tat' of a printed warning, and maybe a hefty fine. Personally, I was shocked to discover that I was developing nationalistic prejudices towards fictional people. (It's always the bloody Kolechians, isn't it?)  It's tough, it's complex, and while it may not be perfect, 'Papers, Please' deserves all the praise it recieves, and I can't reccomend it too highly.",1,0

Sounds like the kind of job your cousin complains about at family reunions.  But then you actually start getting enveloped in your duty as a citizen of Arstotzka.  Do you let the woman without the proper papers go through after her husband who went just before her? Do you turn away the ambassador because of his country of origin? Do you take the bribes or report your findings to the M.O.A.? Do you trust the masked figures? Will there be another terrorist attack today? If the day is cut short, can you make rent? Are you willing to kill an innocent for what you believe is right?   All of these questions an more race through your strained mind as the clock ticks the day away as you pour over document after document for discrepancies, all the while knowing that while processing more people gets your family much-needed money, failure to detect even the SLIGHTEST fault will result in penalty...and that penalty could mean the difference between saving the life of a loved one down to buying a present for your son's birthday.  There are 20 different endings in all, each varying from living happily with your family, to getting executed on suspension of aiding extremists.

239030,"Papers, Please","For a game revolving around paperwork, Papers Please proves itself to be remarkably engaging and oddly satisfying.  You are an impoverished civilian who has had the fortune of being selected to work in border control in the aftermath of War. Every day brings a new list of requirments and rules and failing to adhere to those rules may result in having wages docked - something you cannot afford given you have a family who depends upon you for survival.  Having said that, challenges arrive in the form of moral choices - will you have your wages docked so a woman can flee her ♥♥♥♥♥♥? Will you risk punishment in order to help a friend in need reunite with the love of his life? Or will you side with the rebellion, eager to bring down the corrupt goverment that runs your country?  Every day also bears the threat of having the border attacked by suicide bombers and terrorists, at which point you must take up arms and defend yourself and your collegues.  The game plays smoothly and offers a genuine challenge as the levels progress.

239030,"Papers, Please","Before I bought 'Papers, Please', a friend of mine told me that he'd heard it described as 'the most Soviet game I've ever seen'. It's a fitting description - as you attempt to eke out a living handling passports in the Grestin border checkpoint, it is clear that you are a small cog in a deeply dysfunctional machine. The game grows ever more challenging as you are presented with a proliferation of new rules and regulations, and still more so as you face the challenge of dealing with crooks, smugglers, revolutionaries, and desperate folk of all descriptions, of deciding who to allow through, who to reject, and who to arrest, all with the knowledge that your livelihood and that of your dependents relies on your ability to spot the tiniest of discrepancies in the ten or twenty seconds you can afford to spend examining this particular downtrodden would-be immigrant's documents.  'Papers, Please' breathes a tremendous amount of story and life into the world through the simple mechanism of passports and entry passes. On one day, a woman arrives joyous about the opening of the border, hoping to see her son for the first time in six years. On another, a man tells you about his days working as an immigration officer in another country, remembering how they rejected the majority of those trying to enter there. Still later, a woman from the town you grew up in arrives at your window, remarks as you study her papers what a brat you were growing up, and promises, as she leaves, that she will tell your old neighbors that you are alive and well. And these are characters you never meet again - those like Jorji, Calensk, and Sergiu are a great deal more than that, even as limited as your decisions are.  'Papers, Please' is hard, but more than worth your time.",1,0

It understands a little something called subtlety...something that other triple a games don't understand. It gives you the (surprisingly) fun task of denying or accepting entry to the fictional Communist country of Arstotzka. Some of the people you review for entry talk and the stroy quietly unfolds. I call this type of story a quiet story and Portal is the same way, you are given a task and very subtley you realize what's going on.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a bleak game, set in the harsh world of a Soviet-esque satellite republic. You and your family suffer for your every mistake, and even your efficiency is poorly rewarded.   It's a difficult game, built on recognizing documents and analyzing them as valid, in addition to spotting discrepancies. As your money dwindles, you begin to find moral quandaries: Do you take a bribe to let someone with invalid documents inside your country, or do you keep your meager earnings and reject them? Do you help the desperate at your own peril, or do you only worry about yourself?  With each day, the demands placed on you grow, and with every person you don't process properly, you find yourself unpaid at best, and possibly penalized financially at worst. Why would you play such a game set in such an unforgiving world? Because it's brilliant. It's compelling. Every mistake you make, you KNOW it was your fault. Every unsatisfactory ending makes you want to try harder for the next time, so you can find something, ANYTHING to make this story have a happy ending, even if it seems impossible.  This game is pure brilliance, distilled into a low res form. Unless you simply must have cutting edge graphics, or can't stand a difficult game, you owe it to yourself to buy a copy.  9/10",1,0

As the immigration inspector of the great nation Arstotzka, you hold the power to approve or deny people passing through your country's checkpoint. While that may sound simple enough, the job gets more and more complicated as the days pass by, with you having to deal with forged documents, suspected criminals, desperate fugitives, a secret society, and Jorji Costava.   It becomes heavier by the day, and you can feel the risk grow higher when your family is in need of food, shelter and healthcare.

Do you call to your humanity, let them through, and risk your family's welfare and imprisonment? Or do you stamp denied on their passport to their curses and possible future retributions?

Nobody would ever think that making a game about something a dull as checking passports could ever be made into a truly great game like this one manages to be. The story line has many branching points were you are given the choice to support the current weakened communist government or aid the well-meaning but somewhat foolish rebels, all the while deciding what to do with hordes of people seeking a better life in your “glorious” country.   How it handles the actual meat of the game is very well done, starting you off checking passports and adding to that slowly until you are armed with a sniper rifle, forcing people to do strip searches to make sure they aren’t bringing weapons or drugs, checking fingerprints and criminal records, all the while making sure that their passports, work permits, diplomatic papers, immigration pass, vaccination certificates and identity cards are all correct and not forged in any way.

It sort of reminds me of playing the 90s Carmen Sandiego games, except a heck of a lot more mature and moody. I know it's not the same gameplay at all, but the way it works my brain is quite similar. Either paperwork is more fun than I realized or this game has a whole lot to say about our character. Either way, it's just good.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is deceptively fun...It starts out slow (with good reason) and like in real life your choices early on can REALLY screw you over...even if your doing the right thing. A dark color pallette works well for this game, and the straight forward concept makes it easy to jump into, but at the same time the game does a great job breaking the monotany of passport stamping by throwing curveballs at you (no spoilers). And of course, just when you think you've got a handle on checking d.o.b, gender, home country, work visas, etc, etc, you have to start cross checking more documents.  One particular mechanic that I'm thrilled by is how the timeline is handled. You can jump back to any previous day and branch a new story-line to see different consequences instead of having to start all over again. I don't know how many times you can do this, but even just once is nice, as opposed to starting back from day 1 to see how different day 29 could have been.  I hope to see more from this developer in the future.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game gets to be fairly intense once you get a couple weeks into the storyline. One of my favorite things about it is that it requires both precision and speed, but no real dexterity; the precision required is entirely mental. (Though a quick mouse hand certainly helps a lot—there's an awful lot of clicking and dragging in Papers Please.) Good spatial reasoning is also helpful; a lot of people complain about there not being enough room on the screen for all the documents, but at no point did I fail to find a configuration which allowed me to compare all required documents simultaneously, with the rules a single click away. (And my keys in plain sight &amp; easy reach!)  I made it about 2/3 of the way through the game without a citation before discovering (by looking at a wiki, for another detail) that you're allowed 2 'free' citations every day, and that (aside from impacting your income) they have no effect on which endings you can get or which achievements you can earn—there's no achievement for getting through the game without any citations!  On the morality side, though the tendency is to perceive Arstotzka as a totalitarian dictatorship, or at least to have a corrupt government, I noticed no such facts explicitly in evidence within the game. Certainly they are harsh, and through the tiny window we are given we can see little more than impenetrable bureaucracy which often institutes ineffective or unfair policies (usually with the best intentions clearly in mind), but I don't know whether they are democratic or what the country's economic status is beyond my own family. On the other hand, most of the government seems to function with startling efficiency; when news breaks one evening &amp; new documents need to be issued, they are designed, printed, filled out, stamped, and in the hands of at least dozens (probably hundreds, from the looks of that line!) of people  in other countries  before 6AM the next morning; this applies to documents issued by both Arstotzka and all its other neighbors. Rule books are updated. Permits are issued. At one point, in the time between the morning paper hitting newsstands and me reaching my desk at 6AM, some sort of computerized stamping machine was developed and deployed which keyed into the voice transcription system and created custom stamps for every denied visa—a task which would take months-to-years in the modern age, and this is in 1982; the technical prowess of the Astotzkan is not to be denied. Arstotzka has advanced medicine, develops ground-breaking surgeries, offers affordable healthcare, and appears to have one of the best job markets in the region.  Before you decide to join the side of the terrorists, consider carefully the (in-game) reality of Arstotzka.",1,0

Bits of this game will likely haunt your dreams for a while.  And then you find out that just one guy made this. I recently played Ryse Son of Rome, which was gloriously beautiful and all, but it was as shallow as a puddle in the Sahara compared to this, and that was a couple of hundred people working for years.

But what it DOES is tell a story of political intregue through the eyes of a border crossing guard. That seems like an odd choice, at first, but as a border crossing guard, one sees a large range of different people from different backgrounds trying to get in.

Papers Please in the end is an amazing experience for everyone, either making you look like a good guy to all civilions or or and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to everyone you come across.

I am yet to complete the game to unlock the endless game mode (even though its availible on the internet but dont want to shorten the game life)   Recommend this game is made fun from the different things you have to do, the best thing is picking up a man/woman with wrong sex on the passport, simple x-ray can make you give them a green stamp lol",1,0

You better do, because this what this game is about, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. You can start njoying the perfect made screen which you play in, which consist in the cabine of the checkpoint, the aerial vision of the outside with all the queue of people waiting for pass, and your desk in which you have to carefully read the documents each citizen gives to you. Do you think this is boring? Tell me the same when you have limited time in a day and you have to check the expiration date, the issuing city, the photos, the gender, the validation of each freaking detail on the documents, and other things. You better do it fast, because you get paid for each one you decide right, and you will get nothing if you fail in your decision. By the end of each day, you'll have to manage your salary to feed and keep your family alive, and the game gives you a lot of choices based on moral or your personal preference. Do you want to arrest everyone you can so the guard that works with you pays you a small amount of his bonus? Do you maybe want to help an order that truly wants to clean the government of corruption? It can cost yourself or your family the life depending on the decissions you make, and you have more than 20 alternative endings. Enjoy being a public servant and, trust me, this game is more than it seems. Glory to Arstozka!

Puedes empezar gozándote lo bien hecho que esta la pantalla en la que juegas, que se conforma de la cabina de la aduana, una vista aérea de toda la cola de gente que quiere pasar, y el escritorio donde deberás revisar cuidadosamente los papeles que quienes vayan pasando te darán. ¿Crees que eso es aburrido? Dime lo mismo cuando vayas contrarreloj en un día y tengas que comprobar fechas de caducidad, ciudades de procedencia, género, fotos, la validación de cada ♥♥♥♥ documento que te den, y otras cosas. Más te vale hacerlo rápido, porque te pagan por cada persona sobre la que decides correctamente, y no te dan nada por cada una con la que te equivoques. Al final de cada día, tendrás que distribuir tu salario para alimentar y mantener viva a tu familia, y este juego te dará un montón de opciones basadas en la moral o en tu preferencia personal. ¿Quieres detener a todo el que puedas para que el guardia que trabaja contigo te pague una parte del bonus que le dan por ello? ¿Quieres ayudar a una orden secreta que intenta de verdad limpiar tu gobierno de corrupción? Tu vida o la de tu familia podrían estar en peligro según las decisiones que tomes, y tienes más de 20 posibles finales diferentes.

239030,"Papers, Please","I absolutely could not recommend this game more. To me,  Papers, Please  is one of the best games of 2013, and one of the most unique games I've had the pleasure of playing. At it's face it seems like one of the most boring concepts imaginable for a video game--you play as a lottery-chosen man serving as a checkpoint official for a communist country, and to most people a game emulating government work wouldn't really seem like a blast.  Right from the first few in-game days, though, it provides an interesting challenge that slowly meshes with a branching storyline that depends on how you choose to play the game. Will you play as a patriot, proudly serving your country and preventing dangerous individuals from crossing your iron border, or will you sneakily aid a government-proclaimed 'terrorist' organisation in fighting against your country's tyrannical political system. How you perceive the situation will depend on you, as all in all it's a setting clouded by grey much more than black and white. There is incentive and reason behind running the checkpoint well, too, as you must manage entry properly to earn your salary, which is necessary to keep your family healthy and safe throughout the story.  In conclusion, this game was absolutely worth the ten-dollar price tag, and more, really, and has a reasonably amount of replayability to it because of the numerous endings. You'll probably manage to come across several in your first playthrough, because the way the save system works allows you to continue from the beginning of any day you've progressed to. I would guess that the average player who enjoys this game and plays it two or three times will probably get a reasonably eight to ten hours of gameplay out of it--the average full run for me seems to be about four hours, and I've so far gotten about 16 hours of enjoyed time out of it. I can't promise you'll enjoy  Papers, Please , but I'd be willing to bet you would.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I heard about this game from SourceFedNerd's 'Top 5 Indie games of 2013', watched the first video of a Let's Play, and then decided to get it.  It is worth every cent, easily my most favorite indie game.  The game idea is brilliantly unique, the campaign is fun and not too easy... It took me several attampts and 20h to finish it with my desired outcome, Ending N°1. Afterwards you have 3 modi to play, which are really cool.  In the first one you have 10 minutes to clear as many people as possible, the second one doesn't let you make any mistake and the third one keeps a balance, with an increasing penalty for choosing wrong.

Papers,Please is a very fun game for what it is especially made by a single guy. I love this game although the only fault i have with it is sometimes I dont know what I did wrong or when i feel overwhelmed simply by all the stuff i have to check but at the same time the rush of wanting to hurry and be through. But then again thats why I like this game because you have to be fast and get people done with but at the same time you have to be careful.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a hard sell, after all the sentence 'Eastern Bloc immigration official simulator' sounds anything but fun, let alone something that will maintain interest. Yet despite this apparent handicap, the game is totally engrossing, as you decide who can enter Arstotzka - and it really is a matter of life or death in some cases - and it poses so many questions about the gamers' ethics and morals.  Even though it seems to be a drudgery sim, with you doing little more than stamping passports for the duration, there's several storylines that run through the game and a sly streak of humour amidst the oppression and the dystopian greyness that stops the game feeling grim.  It may not be for everyone, as the game requires you to concentrate on the papers in front of you as well as keep a good memory of the nations and cities around you, but this gives Papers, Please an old school charm from the era where taking notes would get you through a game successfully, so if this is up your proverbial street this is a game for you.

The game presents a lot of interesting scenarios in which the rules feel more like a grey structural outline for the player to either follow or bend a little bit in order to make meaningful, personal decisions.

Some passports are real, others... well they are fake. People would do whatever they can to get in Arstotzka, so be careful. What I personally love about this title is the choices you can make. You can choose to reject an individual's passport to avoid tickets and make money to support your family. OR you may accept their passport to save their dear life..but lose money because their passport is incorrect. It's your call; the power lies in your hands.

There are 30 'days' of gameplay, but as most of the people you meet are randomly generated, the replayability is unmeasurable. Your numerous choices also affect the progression of the story so you can play other story paths you didn't take on your earlier playthrough for new experiences.  Though I wouldn't rule it out, I also wouldn't fully recommend this game for a person looking for a casual game to play, as the game can get very intense, especially later on. That said, the difficulty curve is fair, you have nobody else to blame for your mistakes but yourself.  I could ramble on about this game, but it is truly best experienced by playing it. It's definitely worth the price!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A lot of games are about being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, often taking the role as a faceless, personality-devoid drone, in a dark and dreary world. It is a reason to tire of modern gaming. Papers, Please is about being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, taking the role as a faceless, personality-devoid drone, in a dark and dreary world. It is a reason to cherish modern gaming.  Placed in the role as an immigration control inspector, your job is to apply or decline entry to the fictitious nation of Arstotzka. Carefully checking through each persons documents for inconsistencies gradually becomes a more difficult task as the required paperwork piles up. It's a unique game where the core gameplay experience is essentially administration work and that makes it even more bizarre that it is enjoyable. It helps to have a clever story that builds up around the role you play. You feel as though have the scope to change things in slight ways, but at the same time, each tiny infraction is severely punished. Not only is Arstotzka oppressive to newcomers, residents like yourself must pay high living costs on a very low wage linked to work accuracy. Helping a poorly woman with an invalid entry permit so she can see her son may be the reason your son gets sick. Conversely, taking bribes or being a fascist prick might be the only way your little boy gets to eat tonight! Despite the game world being nothing but the daily newspaper and the cramped work space of your little office, everything you do feels so real and, consequently, important.  Spread over a maximum of 31 days, the main campaign can end in twenty different ways (most of them bad and occuring much earlier) depending on the choices you make and the efficiency with which you do your job. And it's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it. Glory to the Arstotzka!",1,0

Third is all these offers from other people claiming that they will give you money, but sometimes, you can't accept because then your job would be at stake. But hey, that's what makes the game so fun! The part that stands out to me most though, is that at every ending, it says 'Glory to Arstotzka.', which I've found can have different meanings depending on how the game ends. If ended in criminalization, 'Glory to Arstotzka.' can mean, 'You don't deserve to be a part of Arstotzka. Glory to the rest of us.'.

239030,"Papers, Please","A very intriguing and distinct polit-thriller set in an east european-like country in the 1980s. Main location is the border of Arstotzka, where the player takes the position as the border inspector. While the gameplay may look dull and simplystic since you do mostly paper work for 90% of the game, it becomes more challenging as you progress further. You have to watch out and point out every discrepancy in the documents of the immigrants, which becomes much harder since there always come more documents.  The Border is also the main focus point of the plot. Basically it all depends on you how the story will progress. Will you support the secret society who wants to bring change to the country or will you simply keep on doing your job and ignore them? Will you let the old woman who urgently need medical treatment pass or shoo her away because she hasn't brought the right documents? All of this and more depends solely on your actions.

To my surprise when I saw it again around a month ago, when my gf was playing it 5 or 6 hours straight, I couldn't resist to take a look and boy this game became quite entertaining (not too much of a replayability but still). The story is very thorough with lots of details, unique characters and many of endings (about 20) with the difficulty constantly increasing, but never ending being up THAT hard. Game mechanics are quite simple, though it has some lesser flaws (for example I didn't get, why you upgrade your booth to be able to use shortcuts for some useless actions, while real helping stuff is not introduced, like a button to call a next immigrant or a button to 'use a talking device').

But it has a major fault you need to be aware of before buying it.  &gt;This game is about WORKING.  Like a real job, maybe like your real job. You spend the daytime in your office, doing a repetitive task, in a dull and boring environnement. You go back home in the evening, worried about your family members getting ill and bills to pay. And you have to perform well at work, for you salary is based on your productivity.  This is quite stressful and you definitely don't want to go for another work routine when you log on steam.  Moreover everything in this game is so... depressing. It can't be explained with words, but I find that the feeling you get while playing is not enjoyable at all, almost repulsive.

The graphics and music are, of course, a tad crappy. But that's the point! The game is set in an alternate version of the 1980s, so I presume it's been designed to emulate the feel of games in those days. Furthermore, it provides real evidence towards the fact that a game doesn't need to look all spangly to be captivating. In fact, I genuinely believe the game benefits from the simplicity of its style.  The game isn't overly hard, and probably could be made more testing in later levels without destroying the fun, so a possible update from the developers in that way would be a lovely thing.

239030,"Papers, Please","It starts as a linear 'stamping simulator' but, actually the game diversifies a lot from that starting point. You can simply play the game mechanically, doing your job, or you can try to approach it from other angles. I mean, the core mechanics it´s always the demanding validation of documents with different rules being thrown at you. But at certain point the money you do is not enough to support your family. Your son will get sick, your wife cold and you have to decide how you're going to manage your money and most importantly, you will be tempted to get corrupted.    And it´s in that point that the game gets more interesting. It´s impossible not to get corrupted, but how will you manage your corruption? Will you be content with the petty government corruption? Will you go for high level corruption earning more money but risking more? Will you get involved with drugs?   And there´s also the more 'emotional' side. Will you risk a share of your salary by wrongly stopping someone from entering the country because you know he is a human slaver? Will you allow the illegal wife of a legal immigrant to enter the country knowing that your denial will sentence her to death? Will you get involved in a conspiracy to overthrown your oppressive government, and if so, how much will you get involved? Will you kill for it? What comes firts, liberty or family?  All this, and not knowing the ramifications of your actions, because sometimes an innocent thing can end up being not so harmless, gives this game a depth like very few games I´ve played. It´s not a 'boring job simulator', but it does a superb job of putting you on the skin of someone with a boring job and showing that what defines one person is much more than the most immediate layer of his existence. But above all, it an amazing sociological tool to understand how easy it is for a system to get systemically corrupted, and most importantly, why this happens.",1,0

This game is detail oriented, and the faster you learn the rules at the beginning of each work day, the faster you can decide what's more important- to do your job well and protect yourself (and by proxy, your family), or to help those who pass through your check point. My guess is, if you enjoy the gameplay enough, you'll want to play through a few different times and your ethics will become more malleable over time.

239030,"Papers, Please","Aaarrrgh! This should not be as fun as it is!  Paperwork and 'thriller' don't often go together, and when they do they tend to counteract one another, but not in this case. Being a border control officer for a fictional communist totalitarian state sees you enforce a list of ever increasing, and ever more complex, set of rules against a constant influx of would-be transients, visitors and immigrants. Speed and accuracy are the name of the game, you've got a family to keep and the more people you process, the more you get paid. Keep getting it wrong, and you'll be fined. Of course, the transient public don't always make it easy to do that, you'll get your fair share of timewasters, revolutionaries and purchasers of false documentation to hold you back, but you might find a lack of morals quite beneficial.  Every step of the way there are choices, and endings to reflect those choices. The 2D washed-out pallet gives a very Soviet atmosphere, and the soundtrack keeps your mind on the job. Nothing is distracting (that isn't intended to be) and you'll find that if you struggle with accurate work under increasing pressure, you'll find yourself getting much better at it. In this sense I adore the game - it doesn't reward mindless reflexes, it pushes you to focus and better your mental agility.   One of the most challenging games I have played, but somehow I always come back for more!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I have never truly hated a game before playing Papers, Please.  You may wonder why I still recommend this game even though the mere thought of it makes my face red with bitterness. But it is the hate that keeps the game from ever once being boring.  The game starts as you’re thrust into a new occupation in a field of which you have absolutely no experience. You’re paid based on how many people you can shuffle through the border gates, not just by the simple fact that you’re wasting your time at the booth instead of at home. Your savings are dwindling fast, and your family needs food and heat and a roof over their heads, all of which cost money.  So there’s a sense of urgency to this game, a feeling that if you don’t get as many people into the country as physically possible, some unspeakably horrible thing will happen to your family after they’re thrown out onto the streets, hungry and cold. This leads to a mad race to stick it to the people who forced you into this job, to become the fastest passport stamper they’ve ever known. There are only so many hours in the day, and you wouldn’t want to have to ignore the food bill just so you can make rent on time.  Do I recommend playing Papers, Please? Absolutely! Do I recommend that you willingly fork over your hard-earned cash for the privilege of experiencing what is quite literally Work: The Video Game? Well, that depends...  If you’re the kind of person who had money coming out of their ears, the kind of person who already owns at least half of the games on Steam, then by all means, drop ten bucks on it. You’ll probably find it a very humbling experience. If, however, your current occupation so tedious and poorly paid that pounding on books all day would be a marked improvement, and you just want a cheap indie title that will actually run on that clunker you call a PC, then I would strongly suggest waiting until Steam family sharing starts to try this.  (Note: There is a bug that if you “Launch (Windowed)” the game will not record your time playing.",1,0

This indie game definietly packed thriller in a dystopian society where there are betrayals, terrorist attacks, taking up arms, and etc. Even though the concept is simple, hearing the typewriting sound of a citation printing up bugs me, which indicated I had made a mistake in my job. Perfecting your job as an immigration officer is no easy task. The game's 20 endings give it lots of twists and turns, where your actions will lead to another ending.

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' is self described as 'A dystopian document thriller.' I couldn't give it a better description than that. Time is money, and you need to process as many passports as possible before the day ends. The more passports you process, the more money you can make, which keeps your family from suffering. The whole process of examing passports for correct data starts out easy at first, but gets tougher every day with more complex bureaucracy. If it wasn't tough enough to suffer through a hard day's work, you also may find your day ending short with a possible terrorist attack. Although this all sounds masochistic, that is where the true beauty of the game shines. The two problems I have with this game is the short amount of time they give you for each day (frantic indeed), and the fact that it retails at $10. I usually don't have a problem with the price of a game, but even at $10, it is a very simple game that could just as easily have been released as a Flash game on Newgrounds.

Well when you're faced with terrorists, underground organisations, smugglers, lovers, families, corrput police officers, bribary and many more outlandish situations, a day at work is never, ever dull!   Should you sell a digital watch to someone in line to pay for you son's birthday present, or return it to the man who trusted it in your care? Should you be slack with a regular? Should you let someone through the border because a friend asked you to? All of these questions run through your head with evey new person you meet, and all the while, your family back in your apartment are starving, freezing and suffering from sickness... And every major choice you make, the world around you changes, as the daily newspaper will let you know..

239030,"Papers, Please","Although $10 is a little pricey for a game that is not very long, it makes you think in a way many games do not.  This full-fledged game should be no surprise to those familiar with Lucas Pope’s work.The free versions found on his website are unique and explore seemingly simple ideas for a greater purpose. For example, the Republica Times game explores the complex notions of the power behind media, government corruption and political unrest. These same themes spread into Papers, Please, which makes it a very powerful experience. It helps to split the screen into an overall border watch view on top, which shows people standing in line, the person approaching the booth and the movements of the guards. It will also show terrorist attacks and where you will go when given the tools needed to sedate (or kill) people rushing the wall.

Using amazingly simple compnents, Papers, Please weaves a brilliant story that draws you in and makes you care about characters you never see, feel for a state that is truly oppressive, and strive to do the best you can at a boring and repetetive job. Add in a branching storyline with 20 different endings depending on your actions, it is well worth the $10 when at full price; at any sort of a discount, it is a crime not to buy it.",1,0

Like any other game, it starts easy but the learning curve is very steep. Also, the interface does not help. It still needs a lot of tweaking as the interface needs more accurate actions than the graphics let you believe. That is very unfortunate, it makes it a worse game that it could be. The game really let's you feel like you are in acting on the civilian side of a (cold)warzone in some East-European country.

239030,"Papers, Please","If someone told me before playing this game that i'd end up loving a game where you just check passport and travel documents with NES era graphics i would have had them commited to a lunatic asylum.  However this is a game you really have to try to get the appeal and that is definitely worth doing. In the game you play a guy drafted in to work at a border point checking documents. You start off simply checking passports but as the game progresses this becomes more complex as you have to check and inspect ID's, work visa's and other documents. This is made even more challenging as you have a time limit and need to process as many people as you can within that time limit. Each succesful processing you do earns you money which is vital to feed and keep yourself and your family warm. If you make mistakes you can get fined meaning you have less money and a family member could die of hunger or sickness.  The game also has a story to it where you have to make choices about how to proceed. Do you let a poor refugee pass through even they don't have a passport or do you turn them away? Each choice can have benefits or consequences for you so this gives the game a replayability value.  This game shouldn't be so fun, but it is. 8/10",1,0

Not only does it do this, but it has the best morality system in games I have ever seen. Your choices actually mean something, you have power over other people - but mainly because it's actually integrated into the gameplay. Almost every few people that come by, they give you a reason why you should let them through even if they have the wrong stuff, and you have to decide whether it's good enough. You also have your own family to think about, so you can choose to make your family happy or make your comrades happy. While you do have all of this power, the game doesn't fail to remind you that, despite these choices, your position is actually quite terrible.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers please is easily one of the most innovative game ever made. It is hard to believe, that paperwork at border booth can be so depressing, yet entertaining. You are just an ordinary man, who needs to feed his family and pay rent. Your job is to check passports and documents, you need to be correct and fast, otherwise your son will starve to death and you go to jail for depts. However people at borders are desperate to get in, they look for better job, just transiting or they are visiting relatives. You have the power to approve or deny their entry. The choices are really hard, every rule you break (say, to unite a couple) will cost you money and therefore indirectly your family will suffer.   Music and graphic style underline the main theme. The system is too strong and individual cannot win over the corrupt and greedy government. But it gives hope, maybe one day your little contribution will make things different…   Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please was a highly immersive, beautifuly executed game that conveyed a dreary feeling of hopelessnes. In my review below, I break down the game into categories and analyze it thoroughly.  STORY (Spoiler-free): In 'Papers, Please,' you play as an unnamed border processing guard in the distopian country of Arstotzka, and it focuses on bureaucratic efficiency. I personally loved its story telling and thematic choice system. The entire game presents you with mind-racking choices that have to be made throughout gameplay, but the primary dilema focuses on whether or not you will care about others and their woes, or only look out for you and yours. For example, on one occasion you have the option to wave the rules to reunite a pair of lovers (one of whom has invalid paperwork) but doing so will give you a citation, and can potentially cost you crucial money to keep your family happy &amp; healthy. Choices like these kept the tension high, and present the player with a moral conundrum. Many of the choices you make throughout the game influence the ending in a huge way, with most of the endings differing in content drastically. This highly increases the replayabilty of the game, as you'll want to experience all of the different endings. Overall, the story was well done, oozing with atmosphere, and I give it a 9/10  GAMEPLAY: The Gameplay of 'Papers, Please,' is simplistic, but effective. This is a stress management game, as the goal is to process as many people as possible in the time allotted. As a game should, the gameplay becomes steadily more complex as more layers of paperwork are added for you to check. It starts simple, only having the player check the person's passport, but gets progressively harder as you begin to start checking work permits, discrepancies in various papers, etc. Although the gameplay can become repetitive as time goes on, the new layers added on help to prevent total stagnation. It may nopt be to everyone's liking, but I found it effective and fitting. All-in-all, the gameplay gets a 7/10 from me.  ART &amp; MUSIC STYLE: The graphics in 'Papers, Please,' are simplistic and old-school. It has an almost SNES style of graphics, and it looks pleasing to the eye. The art style conveys the bleak, distopian feeling of the game witha heavy gray color palette, and it adds a fitting atmosphere to the game, as it takes place in a circa 1980 distopian, communist, Eastern European country. Although I can see how the art may not be for everyone, so look at the scfreenshots for exampes of the graphics that are to be expected in the game. The music in the game is low, dark, but paired with a slowly increasing melody of some kind of stringed instrument. It sounds very Eastern European, almost Russian, and is paired well with the setting. When both of these are combined, it paints a picture that fits well with the story, and builds a strong atmosphere. The Art &amp; Music gets an 8/10.  CONCLUSION: 'Papers, Please,' is a well done game, and I applaud the creator for doing such a fantastic job. Even though the gameplay is simplistic, the tension is high and the feel of the game is complementary to the setting. The experience that I had while playing this game was one of intrigue, nail-biting intensity, and mind-breaking dilemas. It's not for everyone, and I think it's best suited to a more story-driven gamer, (as the gameplay consists of little fighting and is mainy reading and the occasional button press) If you enjoy a fun experience that is story driven, unique, and dripping with atmosphere, 'Papers, Please,' is for you. 'Papers, Please,' was a gem that should not be passed up on, as most the gameplay sucks you in and addicts you, and this was one of the best games I've played in a while; so for that reason, my 'Papers, Please' overall rating is a 9/10, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy thought-provoking games, as this is a thinking man's game.  Thanks to anyone who read this, it took a while, and I hope you enjoyed my analysis of the game.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","The premise of this game seems incredibly simple, and doesn't sound like something that could be fun (unless you adore paperwork), but with actually fun gameplay, interesting scenarios that pop up from time to time, and complications that make the gameplay just challenging enough, this is a fantastic game. Don't go in expecting incredible graphics, but a couple hours of fun, oddly difficult decision making, and smart gameplay mechanics.  Also, there are 20 different endings, so it's absolutely replayable. I'm not somebody who particularly enjoys replaying games immediately after finishing them, but I found myself playing days over to see another ending, without ever feeling like it was a chore.  Overall, a brilliant game that had me hooked almost instantly. Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Manning a checkpoint and stamping visas may not sound like gripping gameplay but Papers, Please somehow manages it. With your family on the brink of starvation, political trouble brewing and a cast of characters whose lives you briefly glimpse (and possibly permanently alter) the impetus to be alert and make the right choices is very strong. It's a very hard game to put down.  The graphics may seem basic but they serve the dual purposes of paring back extraneous detail to help you concentrate while simultaneously reinforcing the dreary Cold-War era atmosphere. The moral quandaries you frequently find yourself in (you can barely go a day without being offered multiple bribes for a start) don't usually have clear right or wrong answers. Indeed, whenever I lost (often) I didn't get the impression it was because of any moral failings on my part, just making choices (or mistakes) with harsh consequences.  On the subject of losing, this game has one of the best save systems I've seen. It saves at the end of each day so that you can go back and restart from any day of any playthrough you like. You can go back and fix a mistake you realised from two days ago, or try something different or whatever you like and it displays it all in a way that is easy to navigate.  I'll finish by saying that this game might not be for everyone but I have personally loved it. If the idea of a game that's a bit different, that will make you think, that can actually draw you into the life of a poor worker stuck between a rock and a hard place, this is definitely worth a try. It won't break the bank and it will definitely leave you with an impression.",1,0

Papers, Please is a relatively basic game set in an 8-bit style, point-and-click game. Working as a border checkpoint guard, you examine the ID and multiple pieces of paperwork that seperates the person standing before you from entry into the Glorious Mother Country. An 8-bit game has never made my anxiety drive nearly as much as this game does. For each person processed means more money earned, more money means a better chance at living in your cold and dank apartment. Terrorists, conspirators, and your higher-ups all bring about challenges and interesting decisions to make regarding your life and whether or not you spend the next day behind bars. This game is addictive and brings a surprising punch to it's rather simple gameplay with an intricate means of participation and rules to follow. It also sports a darker style of humor with the people you process in a contrasting dark setting.  9/10",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","What an unexpected pleasure to find a game that sounds so simple and, well, boring to be none of the above! You feel the strain of passing citizens into your country without any errors. You feel the stress to comlete as many passports as possible to make enough money to keep your family healthy and alive. When you have a son and uncle sick you make the decision which should get the medicine you can barely afford or should you pay the rent hoping they will live just another day. As the rules change and the different areas of the passports become more important you struggle to get enough correct and through the gate so you can afford necessities for your family and keep your job. I've only been playing a short time but have come to enjoy the decisions that you have to make to survive in a strict regime.   If you enjoy a game that can be played casually but requires heavy concentration then you need to try this out. I thought that everyone who recommeded this game was crazy after watching the trailers. It sounds easy but it causes emotions and attention to detail that I've never found in any other game. Try it out and I dare you not to feel what I stated above. You'll enjoy this game and you can deal with it in short doses or long intense bouts that might even make you have some compassion for those who have jobs like this.",1,0

Taking a look at the provided documents by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested. It takes time to look through the documents and then cross checking them with the book and instructions you have been give to decide if you will approve them passing or not.

The charm of   Papers, Please   comes from the various side events and your constant struggle between your duty as an inspector and your responsibility of providing to your family.  I find the low fidelity art and music rather apt to the narrative of the game and the booming theme is forever seared into my brain.

You really get a sense of what life might be like in an eastern european country during the cold war. If the game had none of the extra details added, it would be a waste of time and money, but those extras really show how a simple game can be made to be so rich and full of depth.

As you get further into the game, entrants take longer to process just from the sheer number of documentation you need to check.

239030,"Papers, Please","How much fun can it be to check people's passports? Well, it depends on you, but I like challenges that make me look for detail, work under pressure, etc. Maybe because I'm a software engineer. But in any case, depending on the type of challenge one finds 'fun' one will like this game a lot or hate it.  In this game you man a checkpoint, checking people's passports and papers to see if they should be allowed through. You also get a new set of directives each round from your fine bosses in the government: work papers required this time, no citizens from a particular country allowed, etc. And since it's a parody of an Eastern-Bloc country under iron fist rule, you are offered bribes and such - which you can take or not, as you see fit. You are also time-constrained because you're paid per-checkpoint person, and if you don't move fast enough you don't have enough money to feed your family, and that's one way to lose the game - your family starves or dies of illness because you couldn't buy medicine.  What makes a game fun is if one finds doing the same thing over and over fun: be it shooting monsters, hack/slash/loot, etc. So if you find this kind of visual challenge fun, you will love the game. If you don't, you will hate it because that's all this game is - checking passports, papers, keeping up with the politbureau dictates, etc.  One of the best off-the-beaten-path games I've played in a long time.",1,0

For a change, you get to be the one giving everyone the business and not the one looking down the business end of such and such thing!   You can also be kind and benevolent and let every person through who has a sob story. Just know, that no matter how you choose to play this game, you (your character, not 'you' yourself) are the most miserable scum of the earth and you're damn lucky to have a job!     I will not lie, there are a few bad things about this game. You need to remember/learn a set of arbitrary rules that are subject to change at the drop of a hat. You're pinned to a small desk where important things are sometimes hidden below unimportant things. You might have to read the newspaper! You might have to see something that you cannot unsee. Anything helpful to you is in a book that you might have to read more than once. All of these qualities make this game confusing but at the same time real.

239030,"Papers, Please","The game, although mundane, makes you want to play longer. This game is basically evil; it forces you to make decisions based on how much money it will get for you. Because you have a family that is cold, sick, and hungry and you need that money, so when a wife wants to see her husband but has an invalid expiry date on her passport, you deny her, just so you can feed your family. The game is quite simple at first, but after a while the rules and paperwork increasing, it becomes overwhelming and highly complex. It becomes even more complex as outside parties begin to bribe you. The main game mechanic is its biggest let down, for most people, it is mundane, checking passports and paperwork for any discrepancies can, and does, get frustrating and boring, however this boredom is key to understanding the game. The people who enter your window, to find a job, etc. just become more paper work, you no longer care for the humans trying to enter. You will find yourself abusing your power just to look after your family; it is a great insight into the dehumanisation of outsiders by a society. There are also hidden achievements which might make some players think again, you have no clue when these achievements happen, they just do, and it is rewarding, even if you lose some money. The game has great pacing, starting easy and ending complex and hard leaving the player in a state of emotional wreck. There is 20 ending which means more replay ability, but some events seem to be scripted and take away the enjoyment, the highs and lows repeating isn’t good. One area the maker (yes, made by one guy) missed was the lack of images for the family, which would have added even more emotion.  9/10- Although mundane it is an emotional tug-of-war that will make you question your morals and help you too understand the people in that position.",1,0

At times you want to do the right thing, but can't without risking your job or a penalty.  It's a long soulless grind that wears you down as a person.  Which is exactly what it is supposed to do. Border checkpoint had to be one of the worst jobs of the Cold War. You are faceless, but not anonymous, you are part of the machine, but not benifitting from it.

Working as a checkpoint guard in the Berlin-esque split city of Grestin, you have to decide who is able to enter the recently opened communist country of Arstotzka and who is denied or even detained. And some of these people stick around in your head for quite a while thanks to their personalities and how you interact with them. You're always facing moral choices with how you handle certain situations, like refugees fleeing for their lives to Arstotzka without the proper documents, victims escaping others in the checkpoint's line who must be dealt with later that day, and others simply trying to save their loved ones. But you must always remember... are you willing to help them at the cost of your own family's wellbeing? Or will you strive to be the best checkpoint inspector to make sure your family is happy and healthy, while giving those seeking help without documents the cold shoulder?  The main story isn't terribly long, but you can unlock a few modes after you finish to keep the game going, and there are up to 20 endings to explore for the main story as well, so you'll have plenty of time to keep the Grestin checkpoint going smoothly.

239030,"Papers, Please","GOTY 2013, Hands Down  Papers Please is advertised as an Adventure title but I feel that it leans more towards Border Patrol Simulator. Although I imagine that it would have been easier to market the game as an Adventure title, but I digress.  The premise is simple enough, you are a border patrol officer working in a fictional Dystopian country whose main driving point is to simply get enough money to keep your family alive. Very straightforward, but the game shines by doing something that is rarely seen in video games; tackling ethical issues such as whether or not to let a woman in to reunite with a long lost relative or letting a man take revenge on the man who killed his child. Money issues are a part of the gameplay too, if you don't have enough money then you won't be able to pay for food or warmth possibly resulting in a family members death. Far more successful than something such as Bioshock Infinite I would say, being the complexity in that game just involved shooting everyone but the fate of people in this game are literally in your hands and can be turned away at the press of a stamp.  As the game goes on, laws become more strict and more paperwork is introduced making the game a chore as it goes on, but yet the game still manages to immerse you in the universe created and never seems to become dulldue to memorable moments where you have to defuse a bomb, or the memorable characters such as the comical drug dealer who attempts to enter the country with a crayon passport.  The art design makes the game instantly recognisable as opposed to 'SUPAH HYPA REALISM 3D OMG' instead choosing personalised sprite work. The game ultimately has a true identity of it's own.  If you let someone in or deny someone you weren't supposed to then the game will issue you with a penalty warning but you don't lose money until the third strike, this is a great mechanic because not only does it allow you to see where you went wrong with that person but it also prompts you to take bribes and you can get rewarded for bending the rules for your favour.  Overall Papers Please is not only the best game of 2013 but also easily one of my favourite games of all time.  FINAL VERDICT: MUST PLAY! GLORY TO ARSTOTSKA!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","One of the more fairly interesting games that I've played. I didn't honestly know what to expect from this but it is actually one of the more morally ambigious games I've played in recent memory (aside from The Last of Us and Fallout New Vegas), you are tasked with being an immigration officer in a fictional communist country in the 80's. It's surprisingly tense with the fact that while you have to let certain people through and send certain people the other way, choices are presented to you from time to time, such as if you should let a certain person through even if they don't have the right paperwork. Do you let a girl's family through but not the girl due to her having the wrong papers? Can you make that choice and live with the consequences? Can you afford to do this as if you get to many citations against you then your pay can be docked which you surely need to support your family who suck up all of your money at the end of the day. It really makes you question your own morality and what you would do in that situation. Sometimes when you feel like you have made the right choice something ends up happening that you didn't expect. They could have been completly lying to you the entire time but you won't know until the end. With multiple endings and an endless mode available this is definitely a must buy if everything I have just talked about interests you. I definitely give it a big recommendation and I think you should totally buy this.",1,0

If given the amount of discretion you have at permitting and denying citizens entry into your country, do you take the high road and risk yourself or take the low road and risk yourself?

239030,"Papers, Please","In soviet Arstotzka, the game plays you!  Explaining the premise of this game really doesn't make you want to buy it: Who would really think that playing a game where you work at a Soviet nation's border station would be challenging, addictive as well as humorous and immersive? Add the fact that this game has the graphics of an early 90's game and it's surprising that anyone has even bought this game. It really is something I've never seen before, even the genre is somewhat hard to describe: It's a 'real time puzzle' game combined with roleplaying elements.  The core gameplay consists of checking people's passports and ID's and other various documents before you make the decision of giving entry or turning people away. It is really challenging and fun. And by challenging I mean 'makes you want to rip your hair out if you haven't lost it from the stress already', at least with the 'no loading allowed' playstyle that I employ.   You have to process people as fast as you can, but making mistakes will also cost you, so you have to balance the speed and the precision. After every day of work, you get to spend your earned money by feeding your family, paying the rent and heating bill, and if things are going well, you can buy upgrades for your toll booth. But there's never enough money for everything after the beginning, unless you're some kind of border guard savant.  It starts off easy: Check if the customer has a passport, if it has expired, if it has been granted in an authorized town and if the person is identifiable from the picture. Foreigners you must turn back. Next day, foreigners are allowed. The next day foreigners and natives both have to have a different kind of extra document to pass and you have to cross-check the information with the passport as well as if the information checks out on it's own. Before you know it, your desk is cluttered with all sorts of papers and you have to remember three faces of criminals that you can't let pass and a couple of names who you have to pass, while shooting people who try to do terrorist bombings at the border.  You find yourself screaming at the screen: 'What?! No way was that entry pass a forgery, you've got to be kidding me! Where the hell is that document? Who was I supposed to let pass and why?!' Things will get desperate soon enough, and maybe you'll let a missing document slide if the customer has some 'incentive' to let him/her pass. Oh, stop being so high and mighty, my son was very sick and I needed the money!  The roleplaying is intriguing as well. There are some really desperate people at the border trying to get you to bend the rules and you will be faced with the decision of either doing your job, or the right thing. Dereliction of your duties will first result in notices from your supervisors and then you will get fined, but you find yourself thinking: 'She'll get murdered if I decline her Visa, and it's only a 5$ fine if I don't, so maybe I'll do it just this once.' You can also team up with different political factions, which have real consequences. There are 20 different endings so the choices matter.  Papers, Please is proof that an excellent game doesn't need a marketable premise or top-notch graphics. On the contrary, it might allow the freedom of focusing on the gameplay aspects that truly make a game great. I know I haven't played this much yet, so this praise is to be taken with a grain of salt, but this might be one of the best games of 2013.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Before I bought 'Papers, Please', a friend of mine told me that he'd heard it described as 'the most Soviet game I've ever seen'. It's a fitting description - as you attempt to eke out a living handling passports in the Grestin border checkpoint, it is clear that you are a small cog in a deeply dysfunctional machine. The game grows ever more challenging as you are presented with a proliferation of new rules and regulations, and still more so as you face the challenge of dealing with crooks, smugglers, revolutionaries, and desperate folk of all descriptions, of deciding who to allow through, who to reject, and who to arrest, all with the knowledge that your livelihood and that of your dependents relies on your ability to spot the tiniest of discrepancies in the ten or twenty seconds you can afford to spend examining this particular downtrodden would-be immigrant's documents.  'Papers, Please' breathes a tremendous amount of story and life into the world through the simple mechanism of passports and entry passes. On one day, a woman arrives joyous about the opening of the border, hoping to see her son for the first time in six years. On another, a man tells you about his days working as an immigration officer in another country, remembering how they rejected the majority of those trying to enter there. Still later, a woman from the town you grew up in arrives at your window, remarks as you study her papers what a brat you were growing up, and promises, as she leaves, that she will tell your old neighbors that you are alive and well. And these are characters you never meet again - those like Jorji, Calensk, and Sergiu are a great deal more than that, even as limited as your decisions are.  'Papers, Please' is hard, but more than worth your time.",1,0

I can't wait for tomorrow to play it once again. Papers, Please! is definitely worth the money.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Way more addicting than you would think by looking at it. You basically play as a Border check inspector in a communist country in 1982. Gameplay is just looking at people's papers and giving them the red stamp or the green stamp. But so many little stories and side plots come up and keep the game interesting. There are also more and more rules added on every in-game day so it gets harder to pick the right stamp. There's like 20 different endings too, so replay value is pretty good. Moral choice aspects are here and they are organic. The game makes it really hard to be a good person. Yeah you might be easy on a person and let them through because they'll die in their country otherwise, but then you'll get cited and oops now you can't afford food for your family that day. Great game for such a simple concept.",1,0

Forget heat. There's rarely enough money for heat.  Papers Please manages to tell stories only through moments desperately rushed as you try to just move people through a line.

239030,"Papers, Please","Jorji Costava 4 lyfe.  In all seriousness I have to say this is quite possibly one of the most mentally stimulating games I've ever played. The amount of multitasking required to stay on top and not end up in debt to Arstotzka is staggering and this may even be educational because of it. As I play through I'd like to compile information into a guide for others so that they can enjoy the story on their own time and serve the country efficiently.  Unfortunately for my friend this doesn't work on Mac. He's very upset about this so adaptation would be much appreciated if possible. Aside from that it's a definite recommendation.  As a Windows 8.1 user I'd also like to add that this game is 100% playable in stand or tablet mode. It can be played entirely with touch screen, most likely not intended but a definite plus for those of us with those capabilities who want to lie back and not deal with mouse or keyboard. To me it actually speeds the process using that instead of sticking to the regular point-and-click method. Still enjoyable in laptop mode as well. Definitely not good in that awkward upside-down V mode, though. I have yet to find a game that's playable in that position. I'll get back to Steam when I find one. (Sorry this turned into a personal narrative.)",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please gets the stamp of approval.  This game straddles somewhere between a Spot-the-Difference and a Puzzler, and despite the purposefully simplistic pixelated graphics, it portrays a grim and desolate world, while also offering the faintest glimmer of hope.  You work as an Immigration Official (probably the first game ever that tries this), just trying to do your job on the border between Kolechia and Arstotzka, amidst the threat of smugglers, terrorists, and basically anyone the Arstotzka officials deem unworthy at the time.  Initially, you'll be tasked with just checking out if the immigrants have the correct papers, and the details within them check out, and so on. The amount of things to check up on steadily increase by the day, which adds to the stress of time management. Do you quickly rush through stamping APPROVED or DENIED to most people without a cursory glance? Or do you fret over every detail, ensuring that you're doing the right thing and letting no scum in?  The problem with the latter, is that you have a family to care for back home, which you'll manage at the end of each day. Food, heating, medicine; this all requires money, which you'll only get from admitting worthy people into the country. This is difficult to prioritise, especially if you make it later into the game when less genuine people are admitted.  Thankfully, there is some great humour sprinkled in to offset the cruel conditions, mostly from the lovable old man Jorji Costava... damn you, you old sneaky rascal.  Overall, there is some replayability, due to the harsh set-up which may take an attempt or two to get the hang of. Also there are many different endings that are possible, depending on the choices you make.  Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I cannot tell you the number of times I've been given weird looks while playing this.  That's simply because it's not a game that's designed with everyone's interest. But, on another note, let's actually talk about the game.  Papers, Please is a game about a border station admittance worker in a Eastern German-esque country known as Arstotzka. You are responsible for allowing or denying entrance into your country. Now, as a citizen in a communist state, you are subject to being fired and imprisoned at any time. With that in mind, you have to make decisions wisely. Full of heart-churning decisions that test every part of your mind, as to what is good and what is wrong.  Gameplay.  8/10 at best. While slow at times, there are moments where a person will get your humor side flowing out of your mouth. Others are causing you emotional pain cuz their passports expired and their spouse made it through but they legally can't.  AI  8/10. Somewhat predictable, except for the occasional terrorist attack. Story 9/10. Amazing. Intrique, excitement, and also action, you'll love it. Overall score: 25/30, or 5/6 for those scoring at home. Buy it, it's worth the $10",1,0

It makes you think about the affect that one person can have on so many others. You are an integral part of hundreds of different stories, some big, some small.

239030,"Papers, Please","You may think, 'Hmm, it's just another retro-indie wannabe game.', but I assure you, you are ABSOLUTELY wrong. Papers, please is all about the story, about what you'd do.

Not only is Papers, please rich in story, its endings also allows the player to be the judge of the story. With 20 endings for the inspector to indulge on, you never know what's going to happen.

239030,"Papers, Please","Glory to Arstotzka! That is the words I felt I have been saying over and over through playing this amazing game. Also DENIED, and a few swear words to vent out my anger.   Papers, Please is a weird game. It is ment to be a passport control simulator, but it delivers as at times, a really challenging game. All your control is the mouse. All you do, it drag stuff and click, but to say the least its not a point and click adventure. Your first day it is simple. Only allow people that are from Arstotzka. Then check all the passports. In the end, you will be checking so many documents, you need to stay on the ball or you will slip up. Massively. I wont be telling anything like said documents, since I dont wish to ruin what is around the corner. The game does have a goal. Do your job. Each person you clear or deny gives your a total of 5 credits. You have to clear enough people to be able to afford food and heating for your family. At times, it is hard. Once, I had to give up food for a day to afford the rent. So what stops you from clearing everybody? Punishments. If fail too many times, you lose your money. That money that will save your family from an early coffin. The problem is, the game can get to you. Occasionly, you will get these people who know they cant get through, but before you tell them to go away, they tell this sad story. Great. Do I seperate the wife from the husband and possibley let her die? Or do I risk it? Nah, it will be fine. The next day, she is in the newspaper. She got murdered. YAY... I feel like sh*t.   I am going to end it on this note. I over the 2013 year, I bought a total of about 70 games. Its my hobby to say the least. I would happy trade them ALL in for this game. Hands down game of the year 2013. I would even say GTA V was worse. If you have the money, just buy it. Why are you still reading, you donkey? GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","GLORY TO ASTROVSKA!  But seriously, I got this game because a friend was playing it. I started playing it and the low quality of it got to me, but I stuck it out then I ended up getting really into it. I ended up finally finding out that there are multiple endings which was cool.  Lets delve into this a little more.  I started playing it, and all I was worried about was feeding my family and keeping them warm. Then some анти правительство группа started talking to me; and I ended up helping им из. The paid me well, I got citations for doing неправильное вещь but still, for the good of ezio я сделал это. After a while, the game got to меня. And now I cant stop speaking России. Its terrible because все, что я хочу сделать, это получить работу в охране границы сейчас .

239030,"Papers, Please","Yes, that's a red thumb. Don't get me wrong this is a good, innovative and surprising game. But it has a major fault you need to be aware of before buying it.  &gt;This game is about WORKING.  Like a real job, maybe like your real job. You spend the daytime in your office, doing a repetitive task, in a dull and boring environnement. You go back home in the evening, worried about your family members getting ill and bills to pay. And you have to perform well at work, for you salary is based on your productivity.  This is quite stressful and you definitely don't want to go for another work routine when you log on steam.  Moreover everything in this game is so... depressing. It can't be explained with words, but I find that the feeling you get while playing is not enjoyable at all, almost repulsive. Right now I remember the graphics, the music, the suffocating atmosphere and I just want to run away and finish this rating as fast as possible.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please, a very grim and sad game. Let me just tell you this right now: Buy it.  Now that that's been said, allow me to explain a bit about the game itself without spoiling it.  You're a border inspector for cold war, communist, Russia-esque country. There's not much gameplay in the game itself except for stamping passports, which you're probably thinking to yourself now 'Why should I buy a game about stmaping passports?'. Because, at the same time while you stamp passports, you're attempting to maintain your family, giving them food, paying heat, paying off rent. So, you essentially have your sob story. HOWEVER, while you're stamping passports you'll have people without some of their documents and they'll tell you their sob story. They'll either attempt to bribe you so they can go through or just hope that you'll be a saint. So you're juggling around whether you can't afford the tickets for your bills or maybe you'll help this guy. But it only gets worse. You have to do this difficult decisions under time. All the while terrorists are invading you borders, independence factions, smugglers, drug dealers, etc.  There's a LOT more to this game, but unfortunately I don't want to spoil it.

For the most part, each day adds new 'things' you need to be on the look out for. As you get further into the game, entrants take longer to process just from the sheer number of documentation you need to check. But you better check it fast cause you're on the clock and your family needs to eat.  Your morals will be tested and you will get stressed out. And you will make mistakes.

The gameplay is easily graspable, fun, and challenging at times, even a bit saddening. It's a simple game about a heavy topic, and it tells a wonderful story which, depending on you, could end not so wonderfully, or just as much.

239030,"Papers, Please","How much fun can it be to check people's passports? Well, it depends on you, but I like challenges that make me look for detail, work under pressure, etc. Maybe because I'm a software engineer. But in any case, depending on the type of challenge one finds 'fun' one will like this game a lot or hate it.  In this game you man a checkpoint, checking people's passports and papers to see if they should be allowed through. You also get a new set of directives each round from your fine bosses in the government: work papers required this time, no citizens from a particular country allowed, etc. And since it's a parody of an Eastern-Bloc country under iron fist rule, you are offered bribes and such - which you can take or not, as you see fit. You are also time-constrained because you're paid per-checkpoint person, and if you don't move fast enough you don't have enough money to feed your family, and that's one way to lose the game - your family starves or dies of illness because you couldn't buy medicine.  What makes a game fun is if one finds doing the same thing over and over fun: be it shooting monsters, hack/slash/loot, etc. So if you find this kind of visual challenge fun, you will love the game. If you don't, you will hate it because that's all this game is - checking passports, papers, keeping up with the politbureau dictates, etc.  One of the best off-the-beaten-path games I've played in a long time.",1,0

Analyzing documents for errors, counterfeit seals, keeping an eye out for suspects, and deciding how to deal with chums with desperate pleas and insufficient documentation, is surprisingly very fun.  I can't say enough good things about this game. I want to say this is my favorite single player game of all time at the moment. Not enough games venture into uncharted territory like this one.  My only beef is that while a lot of the controls are intuitive, a lot of people get tripped up on what to do when a person shows up with no passport.

239030,"Papers, Please","TL;DR Review:  Papers, Please is a an excellent game with some unique, quirky gameplay elements and a strong message, and could only have been made by an indie studio.  Long Review:  As a child of the 70's, I saw firsthand the tyranny of the Soviet Union, though I did not understand it all at the time. Even though the serial numbers are filed off, Papers, Please does such a good job of expressing the combination of boredom and terror that such regimes induce that it could easily cause flashbacks in anyone who lived there.  But the game doesn't hit you with its message like a pie in the face. No, initially you're just a civil servant, trying their best to do their job both for the security of the country and to keep their family from starving or freezing. Denying a correct application or admitting an incorrect one costs you money, so it initially seems simple - follow the rules, be meticulous and get paid.  Then the difficult choices come - slowly at first, then faster and faster as the game progresses. A man's documents are in order, but his wife's are not - what do you do? A superior tells you to let someone through even though their papers are incorrect - what do you do? A woman begs you to deny the man behind her, since she's afraid he'll force her into prostitution - what do you do?  And as the game progresses you realize that while you might be the one making these decisions, the real evil is in the system that forces you to do so - a system you are powerless to change. Or are you?  The game also has a unique save system. Your saves are arranged in a tree structure, and at any time you can click on any day in the game and branch off a new save from your existing ones so you can try new things - an excellent feature given how many different endings this game has.  Cons? Well...you're going to be peering at a lot of text in very small fonts - this actually gave my daughter headaches. The game's difficulty gets almost excessive towards the end, with you having to examine five different pieces of paper, any one of which could be incorrect. The interface for cross-referencing is a bit obtuse and will take some getting used to.  But the game does so much with so little - the graphics are simple, there aren't many sound effects and the overall storyline is minimalistic, but you will be sweating bullets as the game comes to a close. I highly recommend it.",1,0

This is not just a game about who you let into Arstotzka and who you dont, there is a wonderful story woven through it. Every 'mistake' that occurs, whether it be on purpose or not, results in a deduction of your pay for that given day. Will you let in Jorji because he is the funniest character in the game, even though hes on the wanted criminals list? Or will you detain him to keep your family alive? That is up to you, and believe it or not, it changes the outcome of the story completely! The music in this game is also fantastic, and very catchy too.

As you progress even further, you may have to examine an endless avalanche of government-issued documents before you stamp the passport, even if we get careless because of the discrepancies we have to examine, and risk being fined 5 credits for a simple yet serious mistake.  For the game's theme, it's a reminescent of the latter cold war years, such as the Divided Germany up until 1989 and its reunification the following year (Sorry, Korea won't count at all). The whole of the Soviet Union under the toughest of entry conditions before the crumbledown on Christmas 1991, in which the key countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, have eased a bit on the entry restrictions. Talk about present-day USA, more than 76% of individuals entered the country legally without even caring that they're classified as terrorists, while the rest of us, law-abiding people, are flagged as terrorists for no reason, even we can't leave the country (Less than .0015% chance on having our exit visas issued)  Even it gives me emotions on an old lady trying to desperately see her own son after six suffering years, and have to deny entry because she doesn't have the documents, or the one she has are purely invalid, but this is the checkpoint officer's duty, nothing else.  The BGM there, yep, that was the remains of Soviet Russia. Graphics? 8-bit creativity in the modern age, and whoever complains about 8-bit creativity in the present day then that's their problem.

There's something to be said about games that simulate actual work, and this game really takes on a life of its own. It has a real personality to it. You are a guy from what is basically a fantasy Soviet state and you were just assigned a position as stamp man at the newly opened border checkpoint in West Grestin, Arstotzka. At first you must check simple paperwork (valid ID, Arstotzkans only), but as time goes on there will be more government regulations regarding work permits, fingerprinting, contraband, diplomatic paperwork, counterfeiting, etc. that will have you on edge searching for what could be wrong.  It's not just the paperwork checking that is interesting here, but the human relations part too. Sometimes you are compelled to allow a person to slip by because of one reason or other, and other times deny a person who has proper paperwork because of certain tips. Sometimes you must choose whether or not to take a bribe because you have family that you need to feed. You get paid per person that you process as well, so there is also the dilemma of wanting to rush the papers and risk citation and potential fines, or making sure the papers are in order.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I'm gonna start out the review by saying that this game met my expectations. If you were expecting it to be a riviting story with a huge climax and lots of entertainment, then you completely missed the point.  'Papers, Please' is a brilliant take on the mundane job of being a border crossing guard. The thrill of the game comes from looking at every little detail in the ID's and paperwork you're handed and trying to find some kind of inaccuracy. It could be as glaring as their Date of Birth being in the future, to as subtle as a '0' instead of 'O' in their registration number. Your job is to sort through it all and only admit those who present the proper information.  That's not all though! You are also having to take care of a family at home, and you're paid by the job not by the hour. Every person you admit/deny gives you income. Make too many mistakes and they start docking your pay. It's quite the challenge to be fast, yet accurate.  Add to this your work area, which is far from efficient. It's virtually impossible, expecially later in the game, to have all your documents open in your workspace. You have to determine what to look at, and what to leave closed on the counter for the time being.  You also have little side events, like one of the guards making deals with you that'll net you a little more income. You also get approached by people and organizations who want you to allow/deny admitance to others no matter what their credentials. Do something wrong and you can land yourself in jail. Do something right and you can come out on top, while not quite following the rules. Work too slow and you might start to loose family members to illness or starvation. It's quite the puzzle!  There isn't really any excitement to this game. The enjoyment comes from working out a strategy that sees you staying out of jail, your family staying healthy, and your patritism remaining intact. It even has an 'Endless' mode if you just want to keep going and going.  I absolutely recommend 'Papers, Please'!",1,0

I ended up spending several hours on this game and upon completion am considering going back to play it again for one of the 19 other endings.  This is a game for people who like to multi-task, have a keen eye for differences and obscurities, and are fast with the mouse and keyboard.

When I first heard about Papers Please I thought it would be the world’s most boring game, IT IS NOT! These are some of the things I love about.  1) Story: There are different paths which you can take each with their own ending meaning your actions have consequences. This also gives you the incentive to try out all the different possibilities.  2) Art Style: The art style in this game I personally love, it's dark and cold which gives the true feeling of working within an oppressed country. 3) Emotions: I guess this can be connected with the story but there are a lot of people which you can feel for, you feel oddly connected with them and their plight.  4) Difficulty: This game can be confusing, you need to stay on your game and look for the miniscule details and stay on top of your countries ever changing foreign policies.  5) Replay-ability: I warn you; once you start you may never stop. Although you may play little by little the hours add up and even after playing this game for a long time I can still come back to it and play again.  6) Soundtrack: There is nothing better to get you in the mood for playing in an oppressed dreary country than the drumming at the start of the game with classic eastern feel.

239030,"Papers, Please","If you ask me what this game is about, I can't tell you. To describe it would not only give you the wrong impression, but it would be insulting to the game.  'Papers, Please' is an addictive masterpiece, encompassing hummor and morality, as well as mortality. As simplistic tasks become more and more complicated, taking longer to perform, and holding a more intense weight over the livelihood of you and your loved ones, our ideas of morality change. Between bribes, corruption, sabotage, and simple cold-heartedness, the game knows exactly how to get at you, as you race to the end, trying only to survive.  When I tried to explain the game's mechanics to my friends, they were put off by the concepts. In our minds, a paperpusher does not make a great game. Yet everyone whom I've demonstrated to, or let play have expressed their own interest, many of whom bought the game for themselves. So yes, I suggest this game to anyone who wishes to explore humanity at it's finest.",1,0

Using the 'DENIED' stamp is very gratifying for some reason, and the responses can be quite amusing. Do a good job and you get a 'better' apartment (read: more expensive, you never get to see your apartment) and can afford heat and food and medicine for your family. Do poorly and your family might starve to death and you might eventually get arrested. Take a bribe and you might get arrested. Be honest and you might get arrested.

239030,"Papers, Please","It's really hard to convey with words what makes this game interesting. On the surface, this game feels exactly as if you were doing real life work:  - You get a job.  - You are assigned your tasks.  - They feel like a chore.  - You screw up - You get reprimanded - Your responsibilities grow, while your salary stays the same  However, throw in the realities of having a 6 member family to provide for, and it starts getting complicated. Fail to bring home enough money and some family members may have to starve, or freeze. If one of them is sick, you may have to choose between medicine, food, or heating. Will you take bribes then to offset these costs? Will you cooperate with terrorists to get a pay cut? Will you try to get through that gate as many people as you can, since you get paid by the person?   At first it's really easy to make these desicions since you have no sense of what's really going on. After the first few hours go by, and you're grinding along day after day, you start to feel more like playing the character. You start to feel compassion for some of the pixelated people that desperately beg for entry. You start to make judgement calls based on how your family is doing. The game begins to develop into an extremely interesting experience where you're constantly being morally tested.  The game has about 20 or 30-something outcomes (can't remember off the top of my head). So far I've managed to see about 9 of them. Every time I finish I'm finding new paths and possibilities to explore in order to see where the story goes. This is one of the 10 best experiences I've had with video games this year, and I wholeheartedly recommend you give this one a chance.",1,0

The knowledge that someone you are expected to care about can be cold, hungry and sick based upon your actions weighs heavily upon your pixelated shoulders.  I come back to my opening words however, as I will recommend this to everyone who doesn't work in admin. If your job involves papers, dealing with complaints or the public and their documents, this game may not be that fun. I can appreciate the sentiment of this game, but when you work in similar fields, you feel a bit of a mug stamping passports and paying for the privilege, when you get paid to do similar work elsewhere!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","A very intriguing and distinct polit-thriller set in an east european-like country in the 1980s. Main location is the border of Arstotzka, where the player takes the position as the border inspector. While the gameplay may look dull and simplystic since you do mostly paper work for 90% of the game, it becomes more challenging as you progress further. You have to watch out and point out every discrepancy in the documents of the immigrants, which becomes much harder since there always come more documents.  The Border is also the main focus point of the plot. Basically it all depends on you how the story will progress. Will you support the secret society who wants to bring change to the country or will you simply keep on doing your job and ignore them? Will you let the old woman who urgently need medical treatment pass or shoo her away because she hasn't brought the right documents? All of this and more depends solely on your actions.  There are a total of 20 endings and you'll have to replay the game a few times to see them all.

Will you be self-sacrificing, and let through those who need it most at you and your family's expense? Or will you attempt to overthrow the system from within, to improve your family's life in the long-term? These questions are engrossing, and will keep you hooked to the story.

239030,"Papers, Please","Played this game when it was in Beta lil less than a year ago and actually didn't like it much. But that's why you don't play Betas or Early Access, cause in most cases they have very little to do with a real game. To my surprise when I saw it again around a month ago, when my gf was playing it 5 or 6 hours straight, I couldn't resist to take a look and boy this game became quite entertaining (not too much of a replayability but still). The story is very thorough with lots of details, unique characters and many of endings (about 20) with the difficulty constantly increasing, but never ending being up THAT hard. Game mechanics are quite simple, though it has some lesser flaws (for example I didn't get, why you upgrade your booth to be able to use shortcuts for some useless actions, while real helping stuff is not introduced, like a button to call a next immigrant or a button to 'use a talking device'). I would recommend this game to someone who wants to play a game out of the box, had a dream to become a customs inspector and to everyone else.

Everything you do begins to have side effects, you may accidentally let a killer into your country and the next day there will be a headline about it in the daily newspaper.

You have to balance your responsibilities to your country and your family while arbitrarily deciding the fates of dozens of random people.

You need to check the passports of people passing through, allowing entry to the people with the right identification and denying/detaining those without. But the game soon becomes lot more complicated and complex, and soon you have to decide whether to let people through to be with their husbands, despire the fact they don't have all the right papers, or to help stop a wanted criminal, or detain people who haven't done wrong, just so you can get a little extra money so you can get food, warmth and medicine for your family.

Papers Please has 20 endings, all of them are dependent on the player's actions. There are entire storylines that can end differently depending on what you do in the game and I recommend playing through the story mode a couple of times just to see how many things could go the opposite way.  After 2 full playthroughs I think it's the engagement the game requires from the player that is so appealing to me and I have to say that I've had a lot more fun with Papers Please than with any other video game that came out this year.

There is one theme to this game, and it's so bloody effective and perfectly captures the mood of the game; it is bleak, desolate, depressing and oppressive and I love it. The gameplay is deceptively simple and engaging, and considering how mundane the task of what you are doing it is hard to pull away.

It is not as adrenaline-inducing as Ground Zeroes or as hyper realistic as Arma, but it still provides a story and offers the player enough immersion into the game where it actually may affect the gameplay individually. simple terms, the game changes the more (or less) involved you are in it. you spend an 8 hour day inspecting and stamping visas and sending people into the country or back out the door. the rest of it it pretty much covered in the tutorial. it sounds boring, and for many, it is. but for those that like a game that requires a bit of wit and willingness to have fun in it, this is definitely a winner.",1,0

Each day (of in-game time) introduces new concepts and tasks that increase the difficulty curve without feeling tedious.

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is perhaps one of the best I've ever played.  Very simplistic in its graphics and gameplay, Papers Please will take you on a joyride full of moral choices and difficult decisions in the Communist country of Arstotzka.  You play as The Inspector, who was unwillingly chosen to man the border of the newly-opened checkpoint in Grestin, an analog to real-life Berlin. Arstotzka and its neighbor, Kolechia, have just fought a war and, with the peace, the border is now open for Arstotzkans to return to the homeland.  Quickly decisions pile up. You can detain people for more money, which could mean the difference between life and death for your family. You can let in a man's love, who has no papers but her passport.   There will be attacks on the checkpoint, in which you are given a rifle and told to fire at the attackers. All while this happens, you are given critical choices which can decide the fate of the nation of Arstotzka.  There are twenty endings in this game, and each one provides something a little different. But with any ending and any playthrough, the writing is absolutely outstanding. You almost feel sympathy for the people as you hammer down 'DENIED' on their passports. The poignancy of this game is never far from the surface. As a simple cog in a vast machine of corruption and depression, you can change lives for the better, or for the worse.   This game deserves every praise it gets. It deserves nothing less than a 10 out of 10.  Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

That said, expect to put in a bunch of hours into the game if you like it, and then abandon it. It ratchets up complexity in a way that at first makes the game more challenging and immediate, but eventually just becomes frustrating. Also, since the game never lets up, each new day is far more complicated than the one after that, and so a mechanic that lets you put yourself in the shoes of an opressor ends up feeling far more distancing.

239030,"Papers, Please","When I started playing Papers, Please I initially thought 'this is kinda dull. Micromanagement in video game form? I'm good.' But as I progressed more I began witnessing a narrative that unfolded based solely on my own decisions, a story that actually revolved around my character and the world that this character exists in. But this narrative didn't end there as characters began entering into my checkpoint and asking for favors that spanned acrossed several days in the game; favors like allowing loved ones to pass through or to confiscate documents to aid another in pursuing a murderer. And to top all of this off, if you allow unapproved individuals through or prevent approved individuals from passing then your wages are docked and your family may not eat or have a place to live. But the most phenomenal aspect of this all? Every single little decision affects the outcome of the story, and your family's safety and security depend on you making the right decisions from day one. To summarize all of that into one small concise statement: never have I, not even in huge triple A titles, seen a world so immersive and incredibly, heartbreakingly real that I have actually felt bad for not achieving a goal laid out within the games' world.",1,0

Oh yeah, this is a checkpoint that leads into a corrupt, dystopian, and fascist nation.  The game goes out of its way every so often to test your sense of right and wrong. Will you let a woman who lacks documentation but is in need of an experimental surgery that is only available in your country past the checkpoint? Or will you deny her entry in order to retain the job you need to provide for your family?  Gameplay is pretty much just examining people's passports, permits, work passes, etc. and then issuing a stamp of denial or entry. Curveballs get thrown at you though which mix up the variables that ultimately decide whether a person can pass or not. And with about twenty endings, the game knows how to keep you engaged.",1,0

Unlike Cooking Mama though, there's a huge story at work here one, which you as an inspector at a border checkpoint, get to experience first hand.  You will meet several characters, see the arcs they go through, reunite families and desperately try to care for your own, because the glory in Arstotzka is gone, but time races ever forward and you have to meet the standards set by the government or your job, family and freedom will be taken from you.

No team. No preorders. No delays. No feature bloat. He delivered a quality product on time with no frills, and I love him for it.

239030,"Papers, Please","If someone told me before playing this game that i'd end up loving a game where you just check passport and travel documents with NES era graphics i would have had them commited to a lunatic asylum.  However this is a game you really have to try to get the appeal and that is definitely worth doing. In the game you play a guy drafted in to work at a border point checking documents. You start off simply checking passports but as the game progresses this becomes more complex as you have to check and inspect ID's, work visa's and other documents. This is made even more challenging as you have a time limit and need to process as many people as you can within that time limit. Each succesful processing you do earns you money which is vital to feed and keep yourself and your family warm. If you make mistakes you can get fined meaning you have less money and a family member could die of hunger or sickness.  The game also has a story to it where you have to make choices about how to proceed. Do you let a poor refugee pass through even they don't have a passport or do you turn them away?

This is a fanatastic little game that really shows what indie gaming is all about. A simple concept, fully realized and very entertaining. The game starts off simple enough: approve all Arstotzkans and deny all foreginers. Almost every day has new rules added, old rules revoked or new paperwork for travellers to present. It's your job to make sure all forms are correct, all paperwork is in-date and no shennanigans are being pulled.   There are also a bunch of subplots going on which require you to make decisions that may help others at your own expense. Some of these reward you, most don't. It's up to you to weigh the pros and cons along with your own morals. Not only is all this going on but it's all on the clock making for a tense and sometimes pleasurably nerveracking experience. But that's not all! During all this you have a poor family at home and you must balance your income and budget your funds to keep everyone safe, warm and healthy.

You play as an inspector at the border control of a fictional totalitarian state and have to manage your job as well as providing for your family by paying the rent and buying food and medicine. During the story, which lasts a maximum of 31 days depending on how you play, you will have to process dozens of people trying to gain entrance into Arstotzka the country you live in.   You will have to thoroughly check their passports, documents and statements in order to detect any discrepancies. The tasks and documents to check get more and more complicated throughout the game and you will have to face different dilemmas in the game, e.g. allow a woman to enter the country without her having all documents and risk a fine or will you deny her, but at the same time dooming her as she is ill and will die without proper medical treatment.

After an hour or two, the novelty of being a border guard wears off and you start really working to unlock the content, which I just didn't find as fun.  The amount of fun I did have, though, was totally worth the cost. The graphics, 'story,' and interface are all really top notch, and a pleasure to experience.

239030,"Papers, Please","Experience the bureacrautic nature of border checking. You need to keep busy so that your family can afford medicin, food, and energy to keep themselves warm. You get to feel bad about yourself many a time when you need to obey rules, and not your heart.   The requirements of border-checking change every day, and the inspection and pointing out errors in the papers are deliberately made frustrating, and you still need to focus to maintain high quality work in fast enough pace. Failing is ok because of saving system.  Papers, please has good focus with one central idea that is varied though gameplay bit by bit. It tells miniscule stories of many border-passers' life. In a way the game constrasts absolute cold rule system with humanity.   The simple music and artistic style work well for this kind of game. Especially recommended for game designers but it's such a good package that anyone should give it a try.",1,0

I also have to say that, in my opinion, this may be one of the most important games to come out this year, becoming a game I would use as an example to argue that video games can be an artistic medium.

Needless to say, my glorious booth sprung into action, and I proceeded to scan the 'man' for a view of 'his' 'hardware'.

I experienced most endings before getting 100% achievements, certainly all the more notable ones.  As an achievement enthusiast I wouldn't have minded a few achievements tied to the 'Endless Mode' that unlocks after you finish the story game.  Recommended for something a little different.

This is one of those games you have to experience to truly appreciate, as it is fairly unique. I wouldn't say it's a 'fun' game, that's not really the point, but it is enjoyable and rewarding once you learn the rules. That being said, there are definitely some humorous moments that break up all the seriousness.  The game has a certain grace about it, it's very small from a content-perspective, but has enough variety to keep you on your toes. Without spoiling anything, there are several moments that will likely surprise you and you'll realize the developers really put thought into this. Even the standard game over screen is a mix of sadness and humor.  For better or worse, the game doesn't tell you much, which is nice because you learn and experience on the fly but that also means it takes some time to get the hang of, and definitely multiple tries to beat the campaign. Also, a few things seem arbitrary (example, closing/opening the shutters seems pointless?)  Some of the 'find-the-difference' details require a very specific cross-match, and takes some trial and error (or internet searching) to learn what needs to go with what.

239030,"Papers, Please","One word that sums this game up - 'interesting', but a little bland. It's almost a world similar to George Orwell's '1984'.  To sum it all up, you're a character working at the border patrol for a dystopian and authoritative country. Each day, you decide who goes through, mostly based upon if they have the right documents or not. Making a wrong decision can be horrific, resulting in a terrorist attack (probably an inside job); as time progresses, the requirements for entering the country skyrocket. Sometimes letting people through is a question of morale - perhaps they forgot one document and their visa expires the next day... do you risk your job performance for another man's happiness?  One thing that is unique with Papers, Please is the various endings your game can have.  For being what it is, this game is alright.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a brilliant example of two things:  1: I am pretentious as ♥♥♥♥, and 2: That any kind of gameplay can be made engaging.  Papers, Please is a paperwork simulator, which on the surface sounds either absolutely stupid, or you think it's a game made by the same guys who made Goat Simulator and the upcoming Rock Simulator. Well, it's not. Lemme put you on track here. You live in the eastern-bloc country Arstotzka, which has just been in a 10-year war with the neighboring country Kolechia. You are given (more like forced) the job of checking the papers of all the poor sods who want to try and enter Arstotzka, and you have the final descision of giving them green stamp or red stamp. Over time, the bureaucracy intensifies, and the amount of paper that the immigrants supply you with increases as well, until they're handing you entire ♥♥♥♥ing scrapbooks. And if there's even one little flaw, then it's off to talk to the nice men with guns; in the building where people seem to go into a lot, but not out so much. Papers, Please is also probably the game that does moral choices best. It gives you many opportunities to: for example; a man has just entered, and his papers are all clear. Right before he exits the building, he tells you to be nice to his wife, who is just after him. She happens to be missing some of her papers, and so the decision manifests. You can let her in, allowing the two to reunite, but deduct from your salary that you need to pay for food for your family; or you can prioritize your familiy and tell her to ♥♥♥♥ off.

I wouldn't so much as to say this game is super fun.... how fun can searching through documents looking for descrepensies really be? More than it sounds, that is for sure.  I started out thinking ok.... this is weird but I will give it a shot. Glad I did! Surprisingly addictive and simple. You start off kinda slow and gradually you find yourself flying through the rulebook, laying down the laws, and shutting people down! Making alliances with the guards to make more money by detaining people, great.   The more people you process the more money you make. You want to be quick but you don't want to overlook details and send someone through with false documentation, hello citations! You want to be quick, thorough, and precise.

Maybe it's the immersive atmosphere that forces the player to make tough (very tough in some circumstances) decisions for the sake of your job, your family, and your country.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a fun game, but there are some flaws that I feel are often swept under the rug because of the game's admirable, but indie status. The game makes you believe that this is a game that will revolve around choice. The truth is, it's quite the opposite. Much like the strong communistic element present in this game, the choices in this game come sparingly, and the consequences are almost always fatal. This game is more akin to a platformer in that there are a few but very linear paths you can take to reach the 'end.' Stray from that, and the game is absolute. This isnt always bad, but nearly is always punishing. Its a fun game, but I found it greatly overhyped, and equal parts fun and frustrating.",1,0

Pretty much, if you don't make enough to support your family they'll get cold/sick/hungry and will die. Sure, this is a worry people have in real life, but a digital family that has no names or faces, just 'Son' and 'Wife,' is a little unnerving.

The elegance and minimalism of the retro graphics is a perfect backdrop for this multi-ending little paper-stamping adventure. You are a border checkpoint inspector, charged with allowing only sanctioned entrants into the fictional country of Arstotzka‎, run by a totalitarian regime of the 1980's. Each decision will affect you in some way, whether it increases your daily stipend through stipend or bribe, get you cited and penalized (causing you to be docked pay) or puts you squarely in the middle of international intrigue, possibly at the cost of your life or the lives of your family members.

The knowledge that someone you are expected to care about can be cold, hungry and sick based upon your actions weighs heavily upon your pixelated shoulders.  I come back to my opening words however, as I will recommend this to everyone who doesn't work in admin. If your job involves papers, dealing with complaints or the public and their documents, this game may not be that fun.

239030,"Papers, Please","Paper's Please - Documents not in order? Access to country denied. What I love about this game is the moral choices and the grey areas of moral choice it plays with. Also there is a great sense of yay, I found a discrepency, detain him/her. It certainly gives me a new appreciation for border control officers/security. The clever backdrop of pay per processed applicant and penalties if you get it wrong too often, means you cannot buy food, heat or medicine for your wife, son, uncle and mother in law.   The story is so clever, although it could be argued you have the power to let terrorists in, the Country is a dark communist dystopia, and you are poorly paid. Maybe you might agree with the terrorists and let them in to sort out the dictatorial state. I've read from another player there are twenty different endings, well this gives it some re-playability, however, that said, my only concern is that given a few months of stamping visas and passports, I might get fed up. For what it is though, an indie cleverly and well thought through game, I'd give it 8 out of 10. Plus you can get it for an amazing £3.49 while it's on offer so buy it now - or entry across the border may be denied!!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Absolutely fantastic game. I've only played 2 hours of it so far, but I already feel a real emotional connection to the character's family, and a deep concern for some of the people passing my checkpoint. The art style is fantastic, the atmosphere is very thematic and made even better by the excellent music. If I had one, minor gripe, it'd be that the rules get very complicated and layered as time goes on, but really that just feels better, it reinforces the dystopian, opressed feeling.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This is one of the best retro looking games and a unique (to me) concept. It is initially strangely addictive  playing a customs official for a centralised beaurocratic, I guess communist, state. You have to check documents for  people coming through your border check point and decide who to allow into the country depending on the authenticity of  the documents. Too many mistakes and your wages are docked and your family falls ill or starves due to lack of  heating, food, medicine etc. It strikes a fine balance between moral judgements and keeping your family alive. It  gets hard very quickly when you have to perform increasingly more complicated checks. That's its problem for me it  becomes too hard too quickly and feels more of a chore than a game to enjoy. It anyone wants to know what it feels  like to work 9-5 in an office job, particularly a customer service call centre, this is close.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I've only played this a little so far (4-5 'days' in the game), but it is really addictive. Each day adds complexity to your job as immigration officer at the border of some ficticious cold-war era country. The feeling is sad, totalitarian, hopeless. You're lucky to have this job, and your family has been put up in one of the ritzier concrete apartment blocks, where I'm sure there's only three rats instead of the normal ten. As the days progress and the government allows more entry with more fluidly changing requirements, you have to ensure that the documentation people present adds up. Names need to match, documents must be issued from the right place, do they have the right ticket, is it stamped and dated properly, etc. It's a seriously messed up brain game for adults! Oh you'll laugh your backsides off at some of the comments the people make, like trying to bribe you with tickets to the strip club. For the price of a cup or two of coffee, this is totally worth a few hours of your time if not many more.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","If you think you've learned all the rules after a few days, think again! This game will make you check, double check, and triple check your decisions, all while upping the difficulty with each day. This game keeps you on your toes, engaged with each passing second. Every second counts; you need to earn enough to support your family, or it's game over. This is one of the reasons why I love this game; the other, because of the recurring characters and many choices 3909 presents us with. For example, would you like to spend a portion of your salary on a booth upgrade, or save it, not knowing if you'll have enough to pay for survival necessities in the future? Do you accept a large bribe, or play it honest?  Your job seems simple enough; admit or deny people into Arstotzka, according to the rules. Are you always going to play by the rules? Maybe you'll bend the rules to save a life, or accidentally admit a wanted criminal. Apart from the occasional instant recognition of a discrepancy, leading to either denying a person access to Arstotzka, or detaining them, most encounters demand meticulous scrutiny to avoid being penalized with a citation. Every day, the first two are warnings, then the M.O.A start docking your income per mistake.  You can revisit the timeline, and replay any day in the storyline. Will you go for a better score, make a different decision that alters your fate? You can do both. Not to sound clichè, but you don't need to spend blockbuster dollars to get blockbuster quality. If you're looking for a great distraction, get Papers, Please.",1,0

It understands a little something called subtlety...something that other triple a games don't understand. It gives you the (surprisingly) fun task of denying or accepting entry to the fictional Communist country of Arstotzka. Some of the people you review for entry talk and the stroy quietly unfolds. I call this type of story a quiet story and Portal is the same way, you are given a task and very subtley you realize what's going on.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a masterful piece. You play as the lone border inspector at the only crossing of a secluded eastern european nation only just beginning to open to foreigners. It is amazingly deep and each day has something new, introducing game mechanics in the form of more stringent immigration policies, work permits, frauds, and even weaponry. I was hooked onto this game, and I love the dystopian setting. Even though the graphics are barely there in an aesthetic that harkens back to early PC gaming. it serves just enough to have purpose and I think it works perfectly.  There is also a surprising amount of choice to the game. From determining the fate of those seeking to gain entry without the proper papers to things much deeper, and perhaps more sinister. I've found myself playing a cold man following protocol, until certain events eventually led me to sacrifice nearly everything for the wellbeing of my nation. And guess what, that's maybe one out of 20 or so endings. One playthrough will probably get you a few hours, but in my opinion, the story mode is worth replaying for everything you might have missed, not to mention an 'endless mode'.  Additionally, it's not all easy. You must also use your meager income to pay rent and care for your family, which makes the idea of bribes and other incentives all the more appealing.  I heartily recommend this game, even if for the fact that it serves as a very good narrative of what the United States and other nations have done with their travel policies.",1,0

Not only does it put next-gen console games to shame, but it does so with the most ridiculous handicap -- the premise of the game is based ENTIRELY on stamping 'Approved' or 'Denied' on passports at a border crossing.  The game stays intensely challenging from the first 'day' till the last, adding new rules each day to accomedate game events.

239030,"Papers, Please","'First, you say 'where are your papers?' If it goes further than that, it's too late to be saying anything at all...'  Welcome to Paper's Please, a game about being a low level beaurucrat whose job is to make sure that people who enter your country have legitimate papers, are not criminals, and are not smuggling contraband.  Working at your post pays poorly, and you are overworked by an uncaring, faceless government, but you need the money. Your family is at home, and you provide for all of them. If you don't make enough money, they will starve, grow sick, or simply be forced to scavenge for whatever they can because you have been taken to prison because of your debts.  Of course, if that's not enough, there are terrorists who want to tear down your government, and they think that you might be perfect for a new position that just opened up...  Papers Please takes the form of a simple eight bit game where the screen is split into three parts. The top part shows you your workplace, and everything that's going on around you, from the massive line trying to get in, to the armed, poorly trained guards there to keep order and shoot anyone who breaks rules. The left side shows the person trying to get in, and a small desk where all documents are placed, and the right side is your workspace, where you drag documents to and check them against a list of rules that is prone to politics, random changes to fit world events, and other problems.  Not only, however, must you keep these rules in mind, but corruption is the game of the day, and between trying to make more money in not entirely honest ways, to having to bow down to a corrupt superior, life is hard. And your job keeps getting harder.  You only have twelve minutes per level to process as many applicants as possible, and they have a lot of paper work for you. You only get paid for who gets in, however, so be careful not to send too many away. Of course, you can choose to activate an easy mode that sees you get 20 dollars a day regardless of performance, but that's not enough to cover everything.  Ultimately, this is a surpisingly tense game that is more about atmospshere than action, a game that asks hard things of you, and makes you question the rules. How far will you go to feed your family, and how much will you do to help others in a world where there are penalties for doing so?  That's up to you, I suppose.",1,0

I thought there wasn't a story mode but that's all there is at first. The policies and documents get compounded further and further as relations between the fictional country of Arstotzka and the other nations of the Seven Member Forum slowly deteriorate. The game is relatively open-ended. There are TWENTY possible endings (most of which involve the player getting arrested, but hey, do your job and you've got nothing to fear). There is a degree of suspense too.  Sometimes my siblings watch me play it. And when I told them it was available on the iPad as well, my brother wasted no time buying it for himself.

239030,"Papers, Please","This game can be a chore, it can be flat out boring and at times even feels like performing a real job.  And I absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing love it.  Papers, Please achieves what it strives to accomplish flawlessly, it haves you deal with choice, morals and monotonist work with the anxiety of the real struggle of providing for a family. The game sits you at the seat of a checkpoint for the fictional country of Arstotzka where you must asses people and decide whether they will be accepted entry into your country or denied based on a set of ever changing rules and guidlines. Once you open the checkpoint each day you are put on a timer, when this timer is finished the day will be over and you will be rewarded for every person you correctly assesed or penalized for each person who wrongfully accepted or denied entry. You will also be given a screen displaying your family including your wife, son, daughter and mother-in-law (as well as the possiblity of others depending on the path of your story) as well as their independent status' your financial screen which will show your savings, wages, rent and if you are low on funds you will decide whether you wish to buy heat for your appartment or food for your family as well as optional upgrades to your booth which are essentialy hot keys.  Throughout the game you will be given moral choices as to who you accept or deny as an example fairly early on the game (around day 4 or 5) a man is trying to escape a country with his wife as due to some sort of political issues they will be excuted similar to that of prejudices during WWII, his passport checks out fine so you let him through and his wife follows suit however her information is improper so now you may either accept her into the country and be penalized for it or deny her and let her die wrongfully and alone. While some may ignore these choices as neither of these characters are heard from again further in the story you will be given much larger choices which will impact the story, the way your checkpoint is run and even your family.  On the subject of your family they are one of the few short comings of this game, while you need to pay rent (if you are unable to pay rent the game will end) your own well being is not dependent on food or heat, this is simply to provide for your family. Your family is never actually seen nor is there any sort of interaction or dialogue between them and yourself, they are simply a status screen at the end of the day and you are not given any reason to care about them other than 'they're your family'.  As I said at the begining the game can be boring and at times will be hard to find enjoyment in actually playing but that's part of this games beauty, it manages to have you feeling like you're performing menial work and as if you truly are just trying to get by but there's something about it that just keeps you going and wanting to continue. However on that note I would reccomend playing the game in sessions as I found myself getting tired after long sittings with the game and ended up messing up more often, once again much like being exhausted with real work.  While I may not agree that this game is 'art' as some may call it I will say that the game is a beautiful piece and a powerful statement on many aspects of politics and human nature. That all being said I highly reccomend this game and encourage you to play it.  Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

Aside from learning what its like to protect a border from criminals, this game has a secret or two up its sleeves involving a shady society of rebels. There is also fun funny foreign guy who keeps forging documents in crayons.  In all seriousness, the game is a morality decision simulator.

As your money dwindles, you begin to find moral quandaries: Do you take a bribe to let someone with invalid documents inside your country, or do you keep your meager earnings and reject them? Do you help the desperate at your own peril, or do you only worry about yourself?  With each day, the demands placed on you grow, and with every person you don't process properly, you find yourself unpaid at best, and possibly penalized financially at worst. Why would you play such a game set in such an unforgiving world? Because it's brilliant. It's compelling. Every mistake you make, you KNOW it was your fault. Every unsatisfactory ending makes you want to try harder for the next time, so you can find something, ANYTHING to make this story have a happy ending, even if it seems impossible.  This game is pure brilliance, distilled into a low res form. Unless you simply must have cutting edge graphics, or can't stand a difficult game, you owe it to yourself to buy a copy.  9/10",1,0

In my normal day to day job im an office worker, public sector, work with lots of data and figures, challenging but rewarding work.  So i download papers please and now im obsessed with the tiniest details on peoples passports lol.  Such a simple premise for a game yet has me hooked.  Also i guess im the wrong person to be struck by the 'moral' choices in the game, i guess my day job has made me desensitised to the excuses  Whats that your son is sick and you need to get into the country to see him, ohh well im sorry your surname on your passport doesnt match your permit.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is phenomenal indie game that does a good job of making you feel like an actual immigration officer. It starts out fairly simple and easy, but as it goes on it becomes more and more difficult to the point of being stressful(which isn't a bad thing, since that is how you're meant to feel). The game also has a lot of quirky characters that you meet throughout the story mode - some of them are funny, and some of them will try to guilt trip you into accepting their passport.   It is a truly unique experience that is well worth the money.",1,0

It's a great game about, well, border control, but with added elements like moral decisions and the concept of dystopia which is conveyed with great complication through the game's unique graphics style, animation, music and the storyline itself. The game becomes more complex the further you go into it, and it requires a decent amount of concentration although it can be repetitive in some parts of it.",1,0

The dystopian plot allows for interesting character interactions and dynamics. You learn from your mistakes and makes you want to become better each time. The hardships you endure can be quite overwelming. For instance, your son might become ill, but will you work more accurately to gain more money to pay for medicine, or will you see your son perish because of your follys? 10/10 Would buy again",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Unique, funny and challenging, Papers Please is unlike any other game you've ever played. Set in a fictional totalitarian country, you act as a border checkpoint guard struggling to keep your family warm, fed, and healthy. Paid by the number of people you screen daily, you will encounter forgers, smugglers, and, even more morally challenging, people trying to visit sick relatives with improper paperwork. Do you call to your humanity, let them through, and risk your family's welfare and imprisonment? Or do you stamp denied on their passport to their curses and possible future retributions?  To say more of this very clever game would spoil it but it is a steal at the price for modern gaming ingenuity at its finest.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please",Get this game on sale while you can! It is a fantastic indie game that shows the potential of video gaming.

The only bad thing about this game is the resolution support (Total of 3 resolutions) with black bars for the rest. If you run on a sorta low resolution or full 1080p be prepare to move around your entire desktop if your someone who doesn't have much elbow room ever time you change your PC resolution to play this game using your entire screen.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This is a great game! However, I can see it not being everyone's type of game. This is the kind of game that you will either LOVE the subtle detailed beauty and gradual climbing challenge and complexity... OR the kind of the game that you get INSTANTLY bored of. It appeals to a very specific kind of player, in a very rich rewarding way.  The game challenges the player to go to the same office (same screen), and encounter a routine job that requires the player to balance their character's needs, with doing a great job that requires a GREAT deal of attention to detail. This is a game of bureaucratical paper-work and power to change the lives of hundreds of little people. One of the great things about this game is how it gives us a glimpse into the complexities of the old cold-war countries and their struggles with challenges to their way of life, but not as most games where you are an all-powerful head of state, but as a lowly appointed officer, just doing their beurocratical job, a job at the border.",1,0

She was ahead in line, and told me to do something about him. Even though he had legitimate documentation, out of the goodness of my heart, I refused him entry. After being penalized for mistakes earlier, my 'unfair denial' led to me being fined for it, and my family suffered without a necessity because of it. That 'goodness of my heart' led to my game being ended early, because I couldn't upkeep the rent, as of which led to me being detained.  10/10",1,0

Immediately after I saw him play it, I went out, got myself a Steam card, then bought Papers, Please. I sat down the next day and decided to play a little bit of it, to see if I like it. Four hours later, my eyes were darting from paper to paper, trying to find the discrepancies, because whenever you let someone into your country, you automatically tense up, and wait to hear that damned printer noise, printing out your 'YOU WERE WRONG' ticket. It's honestly one of the most tense times in any video game I've ever really played. I've seen reviews on this saying 'Oh this is the boring job simulator and is stupid.' To those people, I would simply like to say that you are impatient morons who should really just go back to Call of Duty. There are only two games in the WORLD at the moment that I would consider, near-perfect. Those two games are, the orginal Portal, and Papers, Please. I'm currently only at about 14-15 hours on this game, but I'm soon going to shoot right up in hours played, because I remembered that I had 'Endless mode' unlocked. So, my record is 58 people processed without getting one wrong, and I intend to push that to at least 100. If I had to give this game a traditional score, it would be a 9.8-10. If you take anything at all out of this review, take the fact that it's an incredible, innovative game made by a genius man.

My first playthrough clocked in at 2 hours, so if you explore every option in story mode, you'll get 40 hours at least, easy. Very much worth it.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","'Papers, Please' is a seemingly monotonous concept on its surface, but the game quickly takes the player on a journey through the life of a Border Checkpoint Official working for family and the citizens of outlying countries fighting to survive between high tensions of this European Cold War dystopian era.  Those who are hesitant to pickup a game that seems to be a simulation desk job about processing paperwork are already missing one of themes of 'Papers, Please'. The games challenges the player to not view the both the in game world and real world as if it is black and white. But at the same time 'Papers, Please' punishes you if you act with morals but shames you for acting against what is right vs. wrong thus adding to the tension of this intense adventure.  Each day you will meet new people, from high class citizens who wish to escape the 'pathetic lesser countries'. To middle class and below who are trying to run from something or someone, and they must now ask you to decide the next step of their life. Either you ignore the discrepancies and take a citation and pay cut for letting someone in without a Passport, or you send them back to where they came from and possibly sentence them to a life of sex slavery or worse. But what if they are lying? What if its a ploy to sneak into the country? What if this is one of those terrorists who is about to disrupt the border and not only dock your pay for making a mistake, but cut your work day short with a bombing-thus causing an even shorter salary pushing you down this slippery slope to another life changing decision; cut out rent in this salary's budget and face the rent raising, or cut out medicine for your sick child and hope the sickness does not progress. You cut out food last budget to help pay for heat this budget, your child should be OK... Right?  The fate of these countries and its citizens, and also the fate of your family is yours in 'Papers, Please'. With multiple endings, the player has many ways to journey through this story of, right vs wrong, conspiracy and revolution. All with one simple answer, 'Approved' or Denied'?

239030,"Papers, Please","Honestly, there's not much to say about this game other than 'I like it' and 'you should play it,' because I like it and think you should play it.  There's something to be said about games that simulate actual work, and this game really takes on a life of its own. It has a real personality to it. You are a guy from what is basically a fantasy Soviet state and you were just assigned a position as stamp man at the newly opened border checkpoint in West Grestin, Arstotzka. At first you must check simple paperwork (valid ID, Arstotzkans only), but as time goes on there will be more government regulations regarding work permits, fingerprinting, contraband, diplomatic paperwork, counterfeiting, etc. that will have you on edge searching for what could be wrong.  It's not just the paperwork checking that is interesting here, but the human relations part too. Sometimes you are compelled to allow a person to slip by because of one reason or other, and other times deny a person who has proper paperwork because of certain tips. Sometimes you must choose whether or not to take a bribe because you have family that you need to feed. You get paid per person that you process as well, so there is also the dilemma of wanting to rush the papers and risk citation and potential fines, or making sure the papers are in order.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","The game itself seems like a very simple 'find the differences' game to start, but it evolves quickly into a game of dexterity and concentration. You realise that you can't always just take your time to get it right and be perfect. You have to process a lot of papers just to keep your family fed and warm, and sometimes you have to sacrifice food, or heat, or that present your kid wants, or medicine. You also realise the while someone has all the right paperwork, you might want to take that hit and warning and deny them. That works the other way where you may let someone in intentionally, take the warning or penalty, but it could be for a good reason or bribe. I've seen 1 ending so far, and there are 20 different endings to this, so the choices you make will mean many different possibilites. I got it for $5 but I would say it is worth the retail $10.",1,0

You must look over documents and use various tools in order to keep spies, smugglers and other unwanted bad people out of the country all while on the clock. On top of this you have to make enough money to support your family and survive yourself. Will you follow the rules or turn to taking bribes to make ends meet?

Instead, you will be required to really focus and try to do your thing the best possible way you can. Even though you might think that what Papers Please has to offer may be boring or not interesting, it is surprisingly intriguing as you realize that the storyline of the game is more than you thought. Papers Please has 20 endings, all of them are dependent on the player's actions. There are entire storylines that can end differently depending on what you do in the game and I recommend playing through the story mode a couple of times just to see how many things could go the opposite way.  After 2 full playthroughs I think it's the engagement the game requires from the player that is so appealing to me and I have to say that I've had a lot more fun with Papers Please than with any other video game that came out this year.

Everything about the game makes you feel the right way - the music, how you are shown the guards, how you are shown the civilians, the way the game makes you feel about stamping a visa, everything.

There is one theme to this game, and it's so bloody effective and perfectly captures the mood of the game; it is bleak, desolate, depressing and oppressive and I love it. The gameplay is deceptively simple and engaging, and considering how mundane the task of what you are doing it is hard to pull away.

239030,"Papers, Please","Now, I just recently beat 'Papers, Please' and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  In this game, you live in the made-up Communist nation of Arstotzka and your name has been drawn in a 'labor lottery' which I have never heard of before, but I imagine is similar to jury duty in America. The particular job you have been given (regardless of whether you want it, because hey, it's communism) is to be a border checkpoint worker. Your family is given a house to live in, but you must provide enough money to keep them safe and sound.  This game starts off quite linear and intriguing as you admit or decline people based on their paperwork and the rules you are issued everyday before starting. As time goes on however, events happen and more rules are added into your book to help ensure the safety of Arstotzka. Each day, you only have so much time to process people and that puts a lot of pressure on you because you have a family you have to pay the bills for.   This game presents you with many choices throughout. Some of these are moral choices or opportunities to make some money. Not all the opportunities are legal though...How much are you willing to do to compromise the nation's security to make sure you have food on the table? There are twenty different endings and the game makes you feel like your decisions actually matter.  As far as gameplay alone goes during the process of admitting applicants, it is actually exhilarating. You know you need to do a good job of examing their paperwork so that you don't lose money or even your job, but you also just want to work as fast as possible to get more money for your son's medication, or to pay the heat bill, or whatever the game throws at you. The rules constantly change and evolve with the times and it makes gameplay an enthusiastic struggle of work ethics, money, and guilt.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is possibly the most fun you can have in the most mundane setting.  It's 1982, and after the six-year war between Arstotzka and Kolechia comes to an end, the Grestin border checkpoint opens, reuniting families and allowing the safe passage of all sorts of characters. As the checkpoint inspector, it is your duty to approve or deny people based on the documents they have and the details therein.  Not only does Papers, Please immerse you in the fascinating world of excessive bureaucracy, but it forces you to make moral choices throughout, determining the fate of travellers and immigrants, aiding or hindering subversive elements, all while ensuring the survival of you and your family.  Such is life in  Glorious Arstotzka",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","So what do you do in this game? Stamp papers. You heard me, the whole game is focused on stamping papers. Lots of papers. To be specific, you play as an inspector who accepts or rejects passenger's passports. Make money at the end of each day by being as accurate as you can. Some passports are real, others... well they are fake. People would do whatever they can to get in Arstotzka, so be careful. What I personally love about this title is the choices you can make. You can choose to reject an individual's passport to avoid tickets and make money to support your family. OR you may accept their passport to save their dear life..but lose money because their passport is incorrect. It's your call; the power lies in your hands. The addition of special events, missions, secret organizations, news reports, and the ever changing requirements, makes this one very stressful game. It's stressful but rewarding.

239030,"Papers, Please","[No Spoilers] Papers, Please is a pretty cool game, but it's too simple for the price tag. I would only recommend you get this on sale. There is a lot of replay value in the game, as there are 20 endings and a bit of random generation throughout, but there is no achievement for unlocking all 20 endings or a log to keep track of it if you are a perfectionist like I am.   The overall gameplay would be completely different for every person however. Every mistake or choice can lead to a different outcome and experience for each player. That's why I like this game, and although the mechanics are simple, it's still very fun. But I just feel that there could have been much more impactful elements added into the game. There were a lot of opportunities to add immersion to the character in the game, like giving more detailed backstory on the government, making the daily events directly affect you and your family (not just your work), and actually having a benefit to moving to higher class apartments, etc.. I know this game was like a runner up for Game of the Year with Gone, Home, which I have heard has little mechanics and just story, so I was a bit dissapointed that this game wasn't overwhelming me with story elements along with it's gameplay.   You WILL have fun playing this game, I still do recommend it. I will definitely purchase the sequel if it's released. But comparing this to a game like Binding of Isaac, which is $5, this game is not worth the $10 price tag at all. The fact that Gone Home was $20 and these two games were mentioned a lot together makes me suspicious as hell. Not sure why they are so overpriced.   TL;DR STILL A GOOD GAME. Just wait for a sale.",1,0

The world painted in this game is bleak and fearful, the more I allowed myself to be immersed in the narrative the more compelled and conflicted I become.   Visually and audibly the game is simple, I find this adds to the bleak vision being crafted by the creator, amplifying the horrible nature of the world in which I was interacting.   The game is simply so consistent in its approach and delivery that it breaks down many modern preconceived expectations for videogames and delivers what makes a good game great, an experience that effects the player, possibly at a core value level.

Every day, this game provides you with a challenge and keeps you on your toes with the storyline. It will keep you actively playing due to needing money for your family. Every night, it could get worse. Or every night it could get better, it depends on how fast and well you work. I also want to talk about this game's many hidden gems. It reminds you that although you have a strict job, you are still human. Sacrificing for others just because you felt bad for them. Or maybe, you just wanted the token. Ending this off on a good note, I'd like to mention one more thing. Jorji. Jorji was easily my favorite character in the game. He'd brighten up the day every time he came and gave me a good laugh.

239030,"Papers, Please","What a delightful treat of a game for only ten dollars, though I'm not sure if the term 'delightful' fits well with the game's dreary Cold War environment.   You play a border inspector for Arstotzka and you have to determine whether or not an individual should pass the checkpoint. The game challenges your ability to recognize pattern discrepancies and memorize information, so if you enjoy that sort of thing you should definitely give it a try. I would say that it isn't the most difficult game I have ever played, but you can unlock Endless Mode after you complete the story for a greater challenge.   There are many, many possible endings to the game, and its well-designed save system encourages you to explore all of them. Most are pretty bleak, which is to be expected considering how crappy your job is, but you can get a few hopeful ones.   It's an Indie game with retro graphics, but I liked the gloomy art style. It looks like Lucas Pope is the sole creator, too, which is very impressive considering how well everything runs. I think I ran only into one bug (I couldn't pick up a document and had to restart) so that's pretty good.   I enjoy dark humor, too, and this game has loads of it. Those of you who enjoy 'gallows humor' will probably love this game. It's certainly one of my favorite Indie titles.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","If you ask me what this game is about, I can't tell you. To describe it would not only give you the wrong impression, but it would be insulting to the game.  'Papers, Please' is an addictive masterpiece, encompassing hummor and morality, as well as mortality. As simplistic tasks become more and more complicated, taking longer to perform, and holding a more intense weight over the livelihood of you and your loved ones, our ideas of morality change. Between bribes, corruption, sabotage, and simple cold-heartedness, the game knows exactly how to get at you, as you race to the end, trying only to survive.  When I tried to explain the game's mechanics to my friends, they were put off by the concepts. In our minds, a paperpusher does not make a great game. Yet everyone whom I've demonstrated to, or let play have expressed their own interest, many of whom bought the game for themselves. So yes, I suggest this game to anyone who wishes to explore humanity at it's finest.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Suprisingly addictive. At it's base it is a 'spot the discrepancy' puzzle game but with a lot of charm and humor. Using the 'DENIED' stamp is very gratifying for some reason, and the responses can be quite amusing. Do a good job and you get a 'better' apartment (read: more expensive, you never get to see your apartment) and can afford heat and food and medicine for your family. Do poorly and your family might starve to death and you might eventually get arrested. Take a bribe and you might get arrested. Be honest and you might get arrested.

239030,"Papers, Please","I cannot imagine any better emulation of the day-to-day life of an immigration inspector on a recently war torn and still somewhat disputed border of a communist-styled country. There are an ever increasing number of forms, each with their own individual nuances, a few wild characters, and the constant threat of poverty or prison. But then, of course, most of the time is filled with repetitive mundane work. Still, I was surprised how fun this grind could be and I think that is in large part due to its oddly intimate nature. People passes by quickly, but in that short amount of time you learn so much about them. Their height, weight, where they've come from, what they plan on doing for the next few months or so, and possibly even how they react when things turn sour on them. That's an awful lot to learn about a person so suddenly. A character begins to form and you start to feel as if you know them quite well. The same could be said about the setting itself. Without much information or discussion about it, this area, vaguely resembling a former Soviet state, seems not only fully realized but legitimate as well. Though, lots of official looking documents do tend to have that effect.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Wow, this game is so realistic that it made me feel I was really an immigration inspector, risking my life to make some money for my poor family. This game includes sacrifice, as I had to decline the most innocent people to get my money's worth; which was very hard to do irl. Also, I had to make the biggest decision of making my son happy by buying him THE MOST EXPENSIVE CRAYON KIT I HAVE EVAR SEEN FOR 25 DOLLA, or buying cheaper medicine for my dying relatives. Its either get a beetiful drawn picture, or have my relatives live. I guess that's probably an easy choice.  I also think its the best FPS game I evar played and the most realistic one. Better than CoD, Battlefield, Counter-Strike, Gears of War, Halo, etc., combined. Two weapons, best first person view for instant killing!  GG and GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA  ~ 9/10  IGN",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is a game in which you take the role of a new Border inspector for the 'glorious' country of Arstotzka. The first thing I noticed about this game was the music. Masterfully composed, it conveyed the perfect feelings through out the game. Your first objective is to make enough money for food and heat for your family, though other things will come up quickly, emptying your pockets. Quickly you come into contact with the mysterious organization: The Order Of the EZIC star. I quickly fell in love with the organization attempting to save a failing dystopian civilization and decided to help them. You can choose not to as well.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is grueling, grim, tedious, and a bad choice if you are looking for lighthearted entertainment. You play a customs agent, trying desperately to make ends meet while filing border corssing papers for a corrupt dictatorship. This game is easily the _opposite_ of what people would normally consider fun.  And yet despite all that, or perhaps because of it, this game is amazing!!!  This is an incredibly well-made game! The attention to detail is amazing! There are countless little human touches everywhere whch constantly break up the inhuman levels of paperwork. And even though all you can do is stamp documents, your choices have a real effect on the world around you. People's lives are changed by your stamp, even yours! There are literally dozens of endings that you can get depending on your stamping decisions. The social commentary is also fatnastic, and the moral dilemmas that the game puts you in -with just your stamp- are gut-wrenching! You will never agonize over a piece of paper like you will in Paper's Please, and you will never look at a DHS or customs agent the same way again!  And that is the game's most amazing accomplishment. Without any traiditonal fun game mechanics Papers, Please manages to be engaging, agonizing, cathrtic, insighful, and a blast to play!

With the pixelart style visuals it allows for genuine character interactment and moments that challenge you to be a good person or to take care of your family where most games that have moral choices fall flat Papers, Please is a shining example of a game that makes moral choices actually work.

Papers, Please is a game where you play as a border inspector, checking over paperwork, looking for inconsistencies, and making choices that impact many lives, including those of your family.  The gameplay can get intense at times as you hurry to process as many people correctly as possible. Papers, Please had me hooked very quickly, and never let go. I'm planning to continue playing even though I've beaten the story twice, just to get all the endings and maybe try out endless mode. There's not much music, but what's there is great and fits the game incredbily well. The graphics are beautiful. Arstotska is mostly devoid of color, and this game looks as it should. The game controls almost entirely with the mouse, allowing keyboard shortcuts if you have the money to buy them and increase your efficiency.  I picked up Papers, Please at full price, and it was absolutely worth it. This is one of the best indie games I've played, and I think it's absolutely worth $10.

The graphics are simple and the actions, repetitive, but the game gets more and more complex as it goes on, and it's so effective that soon you'll find yourself tense, trying not to make any mistakes so that you can keep your family alive, and hooked to the stories of the characters that pass through your office.  100% recommended.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","First of all, 'Papers, Please' is awesome. Here's why:      it's a true indie game that achieves to be indie rather than trying to be triple-A    its art style fits perfectly to the game's setting    it's a great execution in user experience design as it purposedly limits the player's information and activity options    it's a consistent product in every way - setting, UI, story, art style fit together and are consistently presented   Oh, and of course the setting. Making a fun AND informative game about dictatorship and oppression is an achievement in and of itself!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","this game is as soulless as its name automatically denotes. Papers please is quite obviously, a game made for the german populace: it is a simulator that sets itself to be as boring as possible. Visa Inspection simulator, to be precise. and although the screenshots and srt style look blocky and grey, the way the game is played will definitely make you think. It is not as adrenaline-inducing as Ground Zeroes or as hyper realistic as Arma, but it still provides a story and offers the player enough immersion into the game where it actually may affect the gameplay individually. simple terms, the game changes the more (or less) involved you are in it. you spend an 8 hour day inspecting and stamping visas and sending people into the country or back out the door. the rest of it it pretty much covered in the tutorial. it sounds boring, and for many, it is. but for those that like a game that requires a bit of wit and willingness to have fun in it, this is definitely a winner.",1,0

While some may consider the game to be an endless mass of 'paperwork' that's normally associated with getting your passports checked, if you take a little time and become immersed in this retro-feel game, it becomes much more and much deeper.

As the immigration inspector of the great nation Arstotzka, you hold the power to approve or deny people passing through your country's checkpoint. While that may sound simple enough, the job gets more and more complicated as the days pass by, with you having to deal with forged documents, suspected criminals, desperate fugitives, a secret society, and Jorji Costava.   It becomes heavier by the day, and you can feel the risk grow higher when your family is in need of food, shelter and healthcare.

The theme was original, the pixel art put into it was beautifully done, and best of all: the storyline. The storyline itself was in fact a branch game (A game based on your actions) so you as the player had partially gotten to sculpt the majority of the game. The game took place in a foreign country boarder checkpoint and you as the man who was chosen from a random draw to check passport information. After you would complete said storyline you would unlock 'endless mode' which would enable you to play for as long as you desired. The game itself was challenging and required quite a bit of patience, however still was easy enough to be able finish. I strongly encourage playing it no matter what type of gamer you are.",1,0

I'd argue for full price, paying full price is well worth it, but a lot of people might take a quick look and give it a pass. Those people, even people uninterested, should purchase this game simply to support indie devs who are trying something different and being successful. This is one of those games.  Never have I thought that a rather simple looking passport checking game could turn out to have such a complex mood and story told simply through the world and minor interactions with npcs. AAA games tell less of a story with so much more, and no game I have played recently has managed to create such emotions with so little.

This game is not for everyone, if you prefer action packed games, Papers, Please is definetly a game that you will not be intersted in. Every little detail in this game matters, and missing something, or taking too long to make sure you don't miss anything, could kill a family member. Another thing about this game is choice. Many people will give you the wrong papers, But will try and bribe you with Money, or a sad story. You can let this people in and risk your job, or just follow the rules and deny them. There is no right answer, and you can never be a good person. It's deppressing, and while they have 20 different endings, none of them are really a 'Good' ending. I've played through this game 6 times, and I still have fun with this game, but I doubt many people will play this game more than twice.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a pretty novel concept for a game.   You basically do paperwork for a 5 minute day in day out work shift, trying to accurately process as many immigrants as you can. You have to balance your speed and accurately precisely enough to make sure you remain stable in your job.   If you're too slow in processing paperwork, your paycheck will suffer, and hurt your family. The country you live in only rewards labor to citizens with a family to feed, so if you fail them you lose your job. If you're too fast and sloppy with your paperwork, you'll end up either wrongfully denying immigrants, or letting in people with false information, sometimes criminals, and terrorists. If you keep failing in your responsibility to properly check their information, you'll end up getting citations that can deduct from your paycheck and make you lose your job.   As you keep going forward into the game, the immigration process becomes more and more complex, making the game even harder.   It ends up being a pretty good game in time management, and an overall political commentary on the immigration process, and the harsh reality of the work place.",1,0

I dont know how many endings there are, but I've played it a few times and each time the ending is different. Some are more favourable than othesr but none are perfect. A few rounds in and the game becomes a bit of a challenge as you have to adapt to the constantly changing rules, increasing layers of beurocracy and an ever-changing political climate, while at the same time trying to protect youself and your family from destitution.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of the best indie games out there. While the premise of running a border checkpoint may seem boring, the game makes the experience engaging, interesting, and even strangely relaxing. Even while your character really only remains in one spot for the entire game, there is still a very entertaining plot that's progression revolves around your decisions, and each choice has an effect that is well merited; truly it feels unnerving to bend the rules as you know you are being watched, yet it also feels immoral to follow the rules strictly.   My only real hangup with the game is that there is a minor gameplay element involving a screening process in which a person's identification may list them as Male or Female, but after scanning them, their sexual organs are revealed which may (according to the game) be grounds for contradicting their listed gender. As a transgender person myself I found this to be cringeworthy since sex and gender are not one in the same, however as there is no blatant transphobic language and there is no extreme consequence for ignoring this gameplay element, I can assume that the Dev is perhaps just unaware that they are being offensive.....it's tolerable, obviously, as I still very much enjoy this game.  Overall, it's a wonderful and unique experience that I will continue to come back to.",1,0

You play a border guard of the country Arstotzka, tasked with scanning the documents of various entrants to the country and finding forgeries, criminals and more.

239030,"Papers, Please","Thisi s a really great game. On the surface it looks pretty straight forward, but it gets more and more complicated - but not so complicated that it stops being fun. You are basically a border worker who checks documents on people immigrating over. Your job is to make sure they don't have false information, fake documents, bombs, etc... all while saving money to keep your family alive and comfortable. I learn something new with each passing day (each day is a 'level') and if you mess up you can go back to a previous day and start over. For example, I accepted a bribe on day 11 for $1000. A few days later I moved into a nicer apartment. My neighbors reported my 'new wealth' to the athorities and they took my bribe money and are investigating the situation. I haven't found out what is going to happen yet, but if i lose my job i'm going to revert back to the day before I took the bribe money and be sure not to take it again :) Anyway, great game and definitely something to take about with other people who have played.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","“Papers, Please” allows the player to indulge in the fantasy of a border control inspector (quite similar to TSA). The game tackles a lot of interesting and controversial aspects of border security such as body scans and fingerprinting. The game has an inspection view mode which you use to compare sample data such as passport dates or names to existing rules or other data to find and resolve discrepancies.  There is also a very, and I mean very, big focus on memorizing information. You will need to remember just about every little detail about every little rule and you will need to continue to adapt this memory of yours to the ever increasing number of arbitrary rules that must be followed. Failure to follow procedure will result in warnings, fines, and a game over if you push your luck. Sometimes though, you will want to deliberately fail in order to help people out or achieve some other goal.  This game can get downright stressful during the post-review phase where you watch people entering/exiting the country with baited breath, hoping not to hear that telltale sound of a MOA citation being issued. Later on, you have to really be on your toes with all the various paperwork being juggled around and it almost seems like a relief when you find a stupid mistake.  This game is often heralded as an example of when indie games “nail it” on a concept, and I would agree. Papers, Please transforms a boring, repetitive task into something fun and challenging, while still retaining some semblance of story to keep the player pressing on just to see what will happen next.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a unique (as far as I know), highly enjoyable border control simulation, a claim which will probably only make sense once you've started playing.  The mission thrust upon you is to man a fictional border and, using the evidence in front of you and the instructions given to you each morning when you turn up, to decide who to let through into glorious Arstotzka. Getting it right means you earn a living, getting it wrong gets you reprimanded and eventually penalised, which makes the various attempts to corrupt you even more appealing as you struggle to progress from the bottom-grade residence they've assigned you and your family, whilst you try and keep them fed, watered and medicated.   Part memory game, part puzzle, this point and click misadventure balances the need to do a job thrust upon you, whose demands change daily, with the need to look after your loved ones and, perish the thought, yourself. Sounds easy, right? Do your job well and climb the ladder, if only the requirements of your job were not quite so demanding and the clock didn't tick around just that little bit too fast every day as the pressure slowly (and then not so slowly) mounts.  If you only like your games slick and shooty this might not be the one for you, but I believe everyone should try this at least once if only for the music and fantastic deadpan humour, with the very basic graphics ensuring this will run on a wide range of machines (it ran on my old laptop, and that barely coped with streaming video day-to-day). If you're on a notebook, I'd probably try playing with a mouse, as when it gets frantic playing on a touchpad can be quite frustrating.  Completely recommended.",1,0

The sparse story is written well enough to evoke true emotion from you, leading to gut-wrenching decisions that force you to balance your humanity with your survival instinct. While the gameplay is fairly repetitive, the story is rewarding enough and the scenarios are varied enough that it's not really a problem (but if you're wary of the repetitive gameplay, you should still buy it, just wait for a sale.)

This game is an examination of conscience  You decide whether to let people in to Artotzka or not, making exceptions and bending the harsh and cruel rules for bribes and other reasons. You begin to question whether or not to let everyone in, detain them, or deny them.  As the game progresses, you get better at cross-examination, while the rules get increasingly tougher, and the terrorist threats seem to be an everyday occurance at the Grestin checkpoint. This puts the pressure on you, making sure you get through enough people to provide heat and food for your family, or to get that next apartment, or the better upgrades for your inspection booth.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game. This game has so much more meaning in it than the game itself. You find out who you will bend the rules for, and who you won't, who you trust, and who you deny on spot for conspiracy.   Yes, buy it, even if it is not on sale. This game is surely worth it.

I can only think of two downsides:     On the first playthrough, the early days may seem tedious... but that is  intentional . Learning the basics, and setting up the routine, is essential for the later parts of the game. Push through the first few levels, and the story will start to unfold.    On replays of the game, the early levels can feel too simple. Once you're used to handling a dozen complicated rules, going back to 2-3 simple rules feels like busywork.

What captures you as a player is the decisions you have to make, moral, legal, ethic, financial.  It's overall an amazing experience but I would have to warn you, if you don't find the decisions making and experience factors enjoyable in general, this game may simply be boring to you.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please   is a very unique game. 3909 Studios knows how to make a game about simply manning a checkpoint into questioning the ethics of Arstotska while simultaneously questioning my own morals. Through the game things don't get easier. In fact, its quite the contrary. You'll find yourself getting beat over the head with family needs of food, medicine, and heat. All requiring money to obtain, money you don't have. In the beginning of the game I was just a worker keeping criminals and other evildoers out of my country. Then the rent wages went up, my family was getting sick. I noticed that as time went on I started to get more and more desperate for money, accepting bribes whenever I could. I was slowly becoming the person I was originally supposed to keep out. It may be too repetitive for some, but as for me though, they spiced things up enough for the game to not grow stale. The musty pixel art sets the tone in this beautiful game. 3909 Studios did an amazing job, and I look forward to see what else they come out with in the future. 10/10",1,0

I mean, you let them in didnt you? Then there are more terrorist attacks. Then people start trying to get you to join a revolution, and you think hey! Thats something to do if i get bored. You start feeling split between your country and the other people.  Then people start giving you stripper cards. Then Drug money.  Serial Killers. People looking for lost loved ones. Then bribing you to let them through.  And you dont know what to do any more. You have to pick your own side.

Sure, there is an innate challenge towards operating a border checkpoint, however the real depth of the game is its ability to convey deep moral dilemmas through its characters. You'll find yourself torn between moral choices day in and day out, all while just trying to feed your family and pay your rent.

It always somehow makes me come back to it, and yet, the game is overwhelmingly repetitive. Then, I packed up, moved and forgot about this game. Now, for the stuffs:   The Good:   -Has a fairly long storyline.  -Endless mode with a few customizable options once you complete campaign. -If you mess up in the campaign (like when    you accept the $1000 check those revolutionaries give you    ) you can restart on any previous day. -Random events occur.    Terrorist attacks, people so mad at how long they wait in line they threaten to murder your family and then you have to deny them because 9/10 times their passport is expired, checkpoint inspectors who hate pictures your kid draws for you, and other things    -The same main events occur, but you have choices on what to do. Like Jorji. He's an immigrant who tries to get past the checkpoint several times because he has incorrect entry permits, and when he finally gets his stuff in order and you approve his entry, he tells you his passport is fake. -Each day something new is introduced. (No foreigners, Arstotzkans require entry permits, workers need building permits, there has been an increase of disease from Republia so they need a medical report, etc.) -There are multiple endings. (Find them out for yourself! No spoilers from me here!) -The game makes you decide if you should do your job and be a complete a**hole, or be a soft and weak commie border guard. Arstotzka frowns upon you!    The Bad:     WARNING! OPINION ZONE   -In my opinion, endless mode is boring. It is like campaign, but watered down. From what I've played, there are no random events or main events. Nothing fun happens. -    If you side with the revolutionaries, you better know exactly what to do, otherwise when it becomes end game, and you don't do every single task, you are arrested for crimes against the government.    -You better be whisking people through faster than the speed of sound and correctly, otherwise your kid is going to die of some stupid disease. -The revolutionaries keep demanding you to help them, if you don't, they get pretty rude. -LET ME KEEP MY DRAWING ON THE WALL!  If you read this far, thanks? I didn't say everything good and bad, as I don't want to spoil the whole game for you. Get this game if you can, it really makes you question, would you strictly follow the law, or would you slack off just a bit, and let a whole family through, even if the wife doesn't have proper paperwork?

239030,"Papers, Please","Honestly, all this 'indie' garb is new to me. Games that speak a message and look like they could run on a Sega CD are fine by me, though. Back when I was growing up, indie meant the budget aisle at Circuit City, and NO ONE had any insight or comments on the stuff they put back there. Today, there's specialized awards for games that, six years ago, wouldn't be considered games!  Papers, Please is one of those games. Which means this isn't a game. This is a 'life hard-ship simulator'.  Have you ever wished you could live in a Soviet country during the Cold War? No?! I didn't think so. Have you ever wanted to do mundane tasks, much like the day job you fill to pay for video games? No. Me either. Have you ever listened to someone's opinion, only to realize you don't share it, and you've wasted your valuable resources to compare? This is exactly it.  Papers, Please is supposed to tell a tale. But... I finished the game. I was thrown into prison. The end. I was done.  Why should I have to play the game 19 other different ways? Linear storytelling, in this case, would have been better. When your game is based around pushing documents around, it tends to get gruellingly boring. I don't care about plot when I've been doing paperwork for four hours.  10/10 plz dnt buy",-1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is an ambitious game that takes the concept of a dystopian society and the strict controls that are placed on the borders and tries to make it an interactive experience. It's times like this I wish there was the option for a neutral rating on Steam because whilst there are a few positives to the game there are a lot of negatives that I personally disliked about the game.  Starting with positives the nitty, gritty pixelled style of the game is a throwback to the 1980s where this game takes place and adds to the charm of it. It's really great but the downfall of this is that sometimes it can be hard to see if there really is a discrepency that you're expected to pick up on. The music in the game is fantastic (when it plays) and adds to the atmosphere of a society controlled by a strict regime. I literally cannot fault the music; it's perfect for this kind of game to be honest. The save system works on a timeline basis meaning you can go back and replay days and basically create a split timeline which is something that I appreciated as it meant I didn't have to go back and play through parts of the story I'd already seen. It's innovative and something I would urge other game devs to follow this format for other story intensive games with multiple endings. There's very little humour to the game but one of the characters, Jorji, is a light in an otherwise bleak world and it made me smile whenever he popped up into the booth. Cobrastan is best country.  Unfortunately what does let the game down is that after the 2 hour mark it begins to feel more like a job than an actual game and the fun factor completely dies off. Perhaps this was the intention of the game but if you're like me it ends up killing whatever motivation I had for the game. If reflecting the boring job of border control was the game's intention it did a great job at that. The moral choices that you're expected to make sometimes feel cheap and I felt no sympathy for the people I turned away (in fact I took great delight in detaining anyone I could much to the horror of my boyfriend who claims I'd ruin many people's days if I this was my real life job). I'm a sucker for stories that pull at my heart strings and leave me feeling depressed but Papers, Please failed to illicit any of those emotions from me. There are two main stories that you can follow and one is dull and boring whilst the other has a little more action orientated. The former just drags an already dull game downwards. Even whilst playing through both storylines there's very little difference between the two other than choosing to take someone's passport or not, etc. Some variation and more consequences would have been fantastic.  If I look at this game as a game I genuinely cannot recommend this unless you delight in sorting through mounds of paperwork. As a statement this game reflects life in a country being torn apart by conflict and the strict regimes of an oppressive society great (although it's still not fun to play). I'd recommend buying this on sale because you're either going to love it or turn around and absolutely dislike it to the point where playing feels like a chore.",-1,0

Never thought I'd say this but there's just something weirdly satisfying about a game where your sole job is to do paperwork. Seriously, that's all you do!  In Papers, Please, you play the part of a lucky proletariat picked from a lottery to work at a newly established checkpoint between Soviet Union era-like satellite states. Your job is simple; prevent anyone with false or out of date paperwork passage in or out of the ficticious country of Arstotzka while letting the right ones in.   It's just a wacky good time, processing the flow of depressingly monotonal proletarians to the oppressive thrum of Soviet era propaganda music. The revolving door of characters you encounter are very human in their motives for crossing the border and includes concerned parents, arms dealers, and a beguiling hobo.  Your perspective is as limited as communication with the world outside the grey colored Berlin style city while juxtaposed color palettes off set the drabness of your surroundings. The sound is simple yet precise and at times, the compulsion to lick your thumb before flipping through another page of procedural nonsense is simply overwhelming.  The process is intuitive and not too precise in the sense that where you stamp or place paperwork is not a set thing, allowing for a kind of freedom that is severely lacking in more cerebral titles such as Papers, Please. As a result, you'll find that your in-game desk quickly becomes a reflection of your very own in terms of organization and tidiness. Expect the random pipe bomb thrown from the grey clad masses to disperse the crowd which will thus bring about more stringent and meticulous scrutiny from your bosses.

239030,"Papers, Please","Another deceptively simple game. The gameplay is simple. The graphics are simple. The sound is simple.   And yet.  The gameplay is simple, check for discrepencies, approve or deny. But there is a whole depth to it. Your method for chacking. How quickly do you check. Accuracy or speed ? Justice or efficiency? You can loose either way. Your choice also changes your future, with 20 different endings. There's even an endless mode with global leatherboards, unfortunatly, there are obvious hackers.  The graphics are simple, but they have been chose for a reason. Firstly, 3D High-res graphics are not needed. In fact, the retro factor is spot on to when the game is set, late November 1981- early January 1982. Set at the eastmost country of the map, with a totalitarian regime, one can assume is ment to be the USSR.  The sound is simple, but it fits in perfectly with the graphic art style, with its 8-bit sound. The melody of the main theme evokes the regime wonderfully and it matches the title screen.  The save system is ingenious. In conclusion, a good solid and original game, from one guy.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","An excellent videogame. Papers, Please is a very deep and sometimes moving game. You play as a border inspector, accepting and denying people into 'The Great Sovereign Nation of Arstotzka'. There's stamps, entry permits, ID supplements, contraband, guns, terrorism, drugs, smugglers, nudity, passports, bribes, fingerprints, and behind it all, the M.O.A (Ministry of Admission). My only complaint is I've played 6.4 hours, and recieved no card drops. But that's besides the point. Your name was pulled in the October labor lottery. You are obliged to buy this game. 10/10  P.S. Always let in Jorji, he ends up smuggling drugs and then bribing you to let him in.",1,1
239030,"Papers, Please","An oddly captivating game. Starting with the bad. Papers Please has only the roughest, most pixilated graphics, which is generally a big turn off for me, but somehow works for this game most of the time. It only sometimes becomes annoying when things can get hard to read or when you are supposed to recognixe details about a person, but it's hard to tell from a 12 pixel face. It also only has two scenes (outside or inside the shack), but dispite that, it managest to tell a captivating story and be an engaging and challenging game. Perpare yourself for moral delemas and hard decisions that need to be made quickly.   Something that may be a turn off to some casual gamers is that this game is timed (by nature of the plot), so every second counts. This is not a sit back and chill sort of game. It's more of an intense attention and memory test that will get your heart rate up as the timer is counting down for the day and your family is cold and hungry and counting on you. Do you guess or take the time to know for sure? Do you help a stranger or ensure your family is safe? These are the sorts of pickles Papers Please will put you in. The multitude of options allows for a lot of replayability, and it gets a little easier with experience, so don't get frustrated if you don't make it far at first.   8/10 great plot and game design, could use a graphics update.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Review ENG/ITA  A very simple game, the perfect proof of 'Graphic doesn't make the game'. You're an employee hired by the state of Arstotzka to control migratory flow to the border. You should allow the passage to those who own original documents, every mistake will count on your reputation and salary. The game has several finals and some twist though it's simple. But it hides lessons of life, i recommend it for his price.  Un gioco molto semplice nelle sue meccaniche, un esempio perfetto di 'La grafica non fa il videogioco'. Siete un dipendente assunto dallo Stato di Arstotzka per controllare il flusso migratorio al confine. Dovrete far passare solo chi ha i documenti in regola e respingere chi non li ha ed ogni errore peserà sul vostro stipendio e sulla vostra reputazione. Il gioco ha molteplici finali, seppur sia semplice offre ogni tanto qualche colpo di scena interessante. Ma il gioco nasconde anche delle lezioni di vita molto importanti, consigliato visto il suo prezzo.  Vote/Voto: 7,5/10",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please",Initially I thought this game seemed plain especially with graphics and the concept of being a border control officer didn't seem exciting enough but as I got into the game I was suddenly drawn into it and I noticed that there couldn be different outcomes depending on the decisions you make.,1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I once saw a Let's Play of this game and immediatly fell in love with it. 'Papers, Please' is like nothing you have ever seen before, you play as an Immigration Inspector deciding the faith of the people in the communistic country of Arstotzka.  You have to carefully check passports, work permits, vaccination papers and so much more and carefully decide who you will accept and who you will decline and do not take your decisions lightly either! everything you do will impact your game.   Besides immigrants you have have to help your family survive the cold winter in lonely Arstotzka and deal with tons of unforseen events such as terrorist attacks, rebellions and serial killers, make sure you make the right decision because it could be your last!  What might turn you on? - Multiple possible endings, strive for the best one! - Incredible atmosphere, the music and colours of the game truly set the right mood. - Wonderful characters, you just WANT to help some of these people, you will care for them, you will betray them.   What might turn you off? - Heavily text based game, it involves a LOT of reading. - Hard, even though the premise might be simple,   this game is really hard and most of your family won't live through your first play through.  In the end, would I recommend this game? Well if you prefer heavy action based games, super intense RPG games or multiplayer madness shooters then no. Do you love the indie type game, those games that are just so weird you love them for being unique and giving you that playstyle no other game could ever give you? Then hell yeah!",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I'd heard of this little indie game a long time before I finally played it, and I was glad I did. The game isn't particularly complicated, it isn't a drawn out adventure to defeat evil. It's simple in it's premise: you get a job in the fictional country of Arzstoska as a border customs checker. You need to check the passports of people passing through, allowing entry to the people with the right identification and denying/detaining those without. But the game soon becomes lot more complicated and complex, and soon you have to decide whether to let people through to be with their husbands, despire the fact they don't have all the right papers, or to help stop a wanted criminal, or detain people who haven't done wrong, just so you can get a little extra money so you can get food, warmth and medicine for your family.

Despite the fact that your working a deadpan, repetitive job, in a world where everything seems to be ruled by a communist government, with a colour palette that's as bland as the inside of a public school. Yet despite how awfully dreadful the game seems as a concept, it's incredibly engaging.

You're a border guard for a small, fictional Eastern European country, and you're the family breadwinner. You're paid per applicant processed, but fined for your mistakes. So what do you do when faced with a question of compassion against the need to feed your family?

Also your morals are tested as you can risk getting a penalty to accept a bribe or let a woman see her husband depite the fact that her passport contains some errors. Multiple endings make this game full of replayability, but it can sometimes get repetitive depending on the direction you are going making it sort of a chore sometimes. This game can sharpen your skills in being observant and efficient as you have a limited time to earn as much money as you can in order to purchase your basic needs.

239030,"Papers, Please","Recommended, as a peculiar shade of Zen gaming.  I am really impressed by the depth and involvement that such minimal game can punch. Mind, though: in Arstotzska, the game plays you. You may start off cool and grand, but by the end of the day you will have been whacked hard enough, and at the threshold of the (in-game) month you will be all shivers and totalitarian paranoia.  Whenever you try and invest in humanitarianism or just plain friendliness, nastiness and practical losses will hit you harsh, eventually, steadily contriving to scoop your soul away. All you will strive for is to reach the end of the shift with the least damage to your frayed dignity and salary. Whatever it takes to get there.  Slowly, but eventually, you stop sympathizing with those pesky freedom fighters and thinkers and you will be most annoyed with those popping up with problems and stories to unroll. Like, 'FFS, don't come and waste my working time, you incompetent sub-citizen!'  Whoever is not part of the System becomes Persona non Grata, to you personally, and mighty so. The System feeds you, you are its dog. Love the System. Swerve from your cold detachment and there you go, down down the ditch, Persona non Grata yourself.  This game made me understand better my real, East European country: I never realized how easy it is to betray the lofty values of civilization when bread is your only aim, and the aim itself stretches not farther than tomorrow.  Great, might say infinite, replay value: you against the Evils and the dull Average Joe. The game ticks hypnotic and crunches the hours.

Cons:   - You can ♥♥♥♥ up if you're not careful.  - Your family depends on you.

239030,"Papers, Please","Something about this game was really enjoyable. It's not action packed but it has an intriguing story.  It's a bit of a point-and-click your way through your job, but that seems like it would be fairly realistic. The player is forced to monotonously dig through dates and seals of approvals to spot fake paperwork, just like the real border guards. The rules for required documentation was also changing from day to day which makes life harder for both border guards and immigrants.   One component of the game is feeding your family. If you can't work fast enough your family will go broke and you will go to jail for unpaid bills. I was playing on a trackpad and had a hard time with this. Fortunately the game comes with an easier difficulty setting that gives you some help with reaching your quota. Even with this setting on the game can still present interesting dilemmas and moral decisions.   It has a few different endings depending on the choices you made. It was fun but for me it did not warrant a second playthrough to experience an alternative ending.",1,0

You play as a border crossing guard and have to make sure individual's transit papers are in working order. Don't and your pay gets docked and your family starves and dies. You only get a few minutes per day to do this- so hurry up. Going any further may color your impression of what to do, so I'll cut it here.  Paper's Please is at its core a memory game.

The game some how manages in that little cube checkpoint to be all about human relationships, and how compassion and revolution relate, and a million other themes. Even if you don't play compassionately, I think it's still true that it's about compassion. So there's a lot of heavy material, a lot that I still think about after months.

There are so many potential stories in this game, you see so many people come by the checkout, and you are also confronted with whole states, but somehow the story stays small and personal too, in a way that replicates real politics.

239030,"Papers, Please","This is one incredible little game and it all (well mostly) takes place in a tiny little border control booth. It's up to you to let people in to the country and of course they have to have the right papers, a good reason, ID, a visit visa or sometimes even unique documents. The rules of the games change for every work shift that passes you by and you have to make sure that you take a real good look at EVERYTHING to see if the documents are real. If they are you send them on their way in to the country, and if they're not, you send them packing (or call the security on them).   When I started playing I really enjoyed making sure that all the papers are correct and it feelt simple enough to keep a good flow. But... the further I came in to the story everything started to get harder and harder. Checking the papers became a timed puzzle that you have to solve as fast as possible, you have a family that you have to feed and get medecine for, you have events and secret organisations that you have to make sure to keep track of. And once in awhile... you have to reach for a gun... and shoot intruders.   Everything is creating a horrible and very... realistic story which really ends up touching you.

Time is money, and you need to process as many passports as possible before the day ends. The more passports you process, the more money you can make, which keeps your family from suffering. The whole process of examing passports for correct data starts out easy at first, but gets tougher every day with more complex bureaucracy. If it wasn't tough enough to suffer through a hard day's work, you also may find your day ending short with a possible terrorist attack. Although this all sounds masochistic, that is where the true beauty of the game shines. The two problems I have with this game is the short amount of time they give you for each day (frantic indeed), and the fact that it retails at $10. I usually don't have a problem with the price of a game, but even at $10, it is a very simple game that could just as easily have been released as a Flash game on Newgrounds. If you love high stress puzzle games, or ever had the dream of working at your local DMV, you definitely need to check this out.",1,0

It's stylistically low-key (though quite pleasing), simple, and the rules are available to you on-screen at all times.  But somehow the game makes me feel anxious and alert the entire time you're playing it.  Did you check it all? Did you get it right? Every approval or denial leaves you with gritted teeth for the 5 seconds it takes the entree to walk away. As soon as you hear the mechanical whirr of the fax machine printing your mistakes, you kick yourself for missing a detail and keep going.  Really engrossing. Fun to get all the endings, and the way the game saves files makes it incredibly easy to correct previous mistakes allowing you to skip over the need to completely start a new file. A very underrated feature.  Much enjoyed.",1,0

I was unsure that it might become repetitive but I have discovered that the game plays quite the opposite and that I still enjoy searching through the papers of immigants trying to enter Artstozka and trying to deny them entry. There are many great features to this game such as the survival aspect of having to care for your family while dealing with the pressures of border control.

You can surely get involved with the story of the main character and even share his concerns and moral dilemmas throughout the way. It's actually a shame that this game is so short, because when you manage to finish it for the first time, that's pretty much it (even though there're some other endings available).

239030,"Papers, Please","This is one game that most probably overlook. I first learned about this game from watching the 'WTF is...' video for the beta of this game by TotalBiscuit. I gave the beta a try and at first I was like 'well this is tedious' but then when I finished the beta for the first time, I looked at the clock and was surprised by how much time had passed since I started playing it. This was back in 2013 mind you! Now I have it for my PC and my iPad. I skipped the story when I learned that the code to unlock Endless mode was the same across all copies of the game and just looked up the code. It's a great time killer and before you realize it, you'll have all of the Issuing Cities memorized.  I started deriving sadistic pleasure from detaining or denying people coming in with work passes. Why? Because glorious Arstotzka has no need for foreigners. Arstotzka has ablebodied workforce of its own. Arstotzka has labor lottery to solve labor shortages. Visit, pass through, immigrate, or seek asylum with Arstotzka. No need for filthy foreigners, especially from Kolechia. But Ministry of Labor says we need foreign labor. Why they impliment work pass system. Will still deny at every possibility.  I will say this though. Between the original PC version and the version on tablets, the tablet version is easier to play. Story is exactly the same and the endless mode code is the same as the PC version too. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game and severely underrated.  So if you're new to Paper's Please,   'Cause no trouble.'  Or if you're a veteran inspector like me...  'Glory to Arstotzka!'",1,0

Everything about this game adds to the story from the dreary atmosphere to the sympathetic characters, and it's this context that turns the dull mechanics into something truly tense and deep.  Possibly the most appealing aspect are the choices you make. The ones you make are both big and small, but you only ever have a few seconds to decide on something that could change the lives of the people you meet. The game genuinely gives the chance to confront these situations, and is more worthy of a game than most because of it.",1,0

Dont be a graphics dude and buy games for its grapics cus honestly the best games that i have played just happen to have poor grapics and there indies. Now the gameplay is exaclty what it says. You get papers u look for unmatched data, if u find somthing wrong u have to interagte them and if it wrong u can detain or deny there passport or they may offer u a bribe. Now the game is fun in the beggining but after awhile it gets boring. Yes there are chages to the rules and events but your still stamping papers. Yes thats main object of the game but it does get boring. Its literally like the job. Its fun for some people who dont like all the action and fake stuff. This is more calm and mature.

239030,"Papers, Please","Welcome to Old Soviet Russia simulator, comrades! Papers Please is a game that puts you on a inmigrant inspector's shoes, being your task to check the documments the people willing to enter on your country present to you. The beginning is simple enough: just the passport. Check if the issuing city is right, the expiration date, if the person in the photo looks like the one in front of you... you know, the basics. After that, slam either the 'approved' or 'denied' stampt, and call the next one. You are paid according to how many people you process a day, and if you mess up, a penalty is applied over your salary.  Now, as days pass and world wide events take place, more and more documments are required to enter the country. Entry Permits, Work Permits, Diplomatic Authorizations, IDs... to mention a few. You reach a point in which your table is covered by paperwork, each sheet of paper with lots of data to check. You will encounter wanted crimminals, smugglers, counterfeiters, terrorists and poor people who just want to get through. Your paycheck, which was already misserable, gets smaller and smaller as you process less people (since each takes more time now), screw up more times (don't blame yourself, it's hard not to do that) and the cost of your life goes up (you have to maintain a family of four, plus rent, plus unexpected expenses). You will have to resort to accept bribes, get innocent people arrested to collect bonuses, and be ruthless in general to get those extra coins you need. Important decissions will have to be made, and those will have an impact in the rest of the game.  It's a game that invites you to think. Will you throw your morals out of the window or try to bite the bullet and help the poor chaps in need? It's the law of the jungle out there. Let's see where this get us to.  + Heavily replayable, with multiple endings. + The difficulty curve is steep, but fair. But that doesn't mean that the game will go easy on you... + The story is depressing and surprisingly realistic. ♥♥♥♥ like this happened back in the day. + Extremely easy to learn, and also to fail at. Your doom can come out of anywhere, and there is no way to avoid it. - Feels less like a game and more like an actual job, which I guess is what the devs were aiming at (tip of the hat in that case), but playing Papers Please sure takes a toll on me. - I said that the game is fair, but when you mess up too many times it comes crashing down on you like you wouldn't believe. Penalties in the late game are brutal, but you only have yourself to blame, for not paying enough attention.  This game gets a 8 out of 10. Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

Aside from things getting more and more bureaucratic and challenging to get through each day, the creator also manages to weave in interesting storylines and moral dilemmas. Do you let in the human trafficker or a child molester. Will you let people get killed by turning them back to their hostile homeland. Do you help an underground organization doing their missions. Mess with politics? Will you be able to pay the bill in the end of the day. Can your son go without his medicine, or shall we not eat for a few days. Just to name some questions that arise.

I was playing just earlier and had a woman come in, with her description being 'overweight' at 71kg, height around 160-170 something although she looked quite short. Another thing regarding height, is that when a short person comes through and I have to do an X-ray, they're as tall as any other man or woman.

Your main goal is to follow your handbook and accept or deny people coming into Arstotzka, sounds like it would get repeitive or boring right? Wrong! there is so much that is put into the games that makes the game a blast to play. Like overthrowing your own corrupt government by helping a revoultionary group or being a over powering ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that helps the people who bribe you while letting the others go back the filthy Kolechia, there is literally so much content and variety of endings into this game, even some that make you laugh of loud like going to jail for hanging things on your wall. This game is totally worth its price.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","“Papers, Please” allows the player to indulge in the fantasy of a border control inspector (quite similar to TSA). The game tackles a lot of interesting and controversial aspects of border security such as body scans and fingerprinting. The game has an inspection view mode which you use to compare sample data such as passport dates or names to existing rules or other data to find and resolve discrepancies.  There is also a very, and I mean very, big focus on memorizing information. You will need to remember just about every little detail about every little rule and you will need to continue to adapt this memory of yours to the ever increasing number of arbitrary rules that must be followed. Failure to follow procedure will result in warnings, fines, and a game over if you push your luck. Sometimes though, you will want to deliberately fail in order to help people out or achieve some other goal.  This game can get downright stressful during the post-review phase where you watch people entering/exiting the country with baited breath, hoping not to hear that telltale sound of a MOA citation being issued. Later on, you have to really be on your toes with all the various paperwork being juggled around and it almost seems like a relief when you find a stupid mistake.  This game is often heralded as an example of when indie games “nail it” on a concept, and I would agree. Papers, Please transforms a boring, repetitive task into something fun and challenging, while still retaining some semblance of story to keep the player pressing on just to see what will happen next.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a unique (as far as I know), highly enjoyable border control simulation, a claim which will probably only make sense once you've started playing.  The mission thrust upon you is to man a fictional border and, using the evidence in front of you and the instructions given to you each morning when you turn up, to decide who to let through into glorious Arstotzka. Getting it right means you earn a living, getting it wrong gets you reprimanded and eventually penalised, which makes the various attempts to corrupt you even more appealing as you struggle to progress from the bottom-grade residence they've assigned you and your family, whilst you try and keep them fed, watered and medicated.   Part memory game, part puzzle, this point and click misadventure balances the need to do a job thrust upon you, whose demands change daily, with the need to look after your loved ones and, perish the thought, yourself. Sounds easy, right? Do your job well and climb the ladder, if only the requirements of your job were not quite so demanding and the clock didn't tick around just that little bit too fast every day as the pressure slowly (and then not so slowly) mounts.  If you only like your games slick and shooty this might not be the one for you, but I believe everyone should try this at least once if only for the music and fantastic deadpan humour, with the very basic graphics ensuring this will run on a wide range of machines (it ran on my old laptop, and that barely coped with streaming video day-to-day). If you're on a notebook, I'd probably try playing with a mouse, as when it gets frantic playing on a touchpad can be quite frustrating.  Completely recommended.",1,0

Save it for your family or you'll be sent to prison under suspicion and your money will be confiscated under 'further investigation'.  Two endings already and I've only received the bad ones.  I've given this game a thumbs up because I found this game not only fun, but original and creative, and as the game can be quite brutal at times, it also pushes me to make new walkthroughs so I can progress further through the game, which, intern gives a greater sense of accomplishment after I've beaten my record and for that I strongly recommend you purchasing this game.",1,0

You can overlook a discrepancy to allow a wife return to her husband, but if you can't afford medicine for your family then you have to realistically consider having her jailed and use the commission to pay for treatment.  Papers, Please puts you in many of these scenarios and stretches your ability to act in a moral way. You will eventually realise that some situations cannot be resolved without something horrible happening to someone - and you are the pivotal deciding factor. A lot of time is spent afterwards justifying the decision to yourself.

239030,"Papers, Please","Even with only 3 hours spent in this game I reccomend it. I watched some playthrough's on YouTube (mostly JSE) and liked those, so I got it for myself. A fairly simple game, it downloaded in 30 seconds on my crap wifi and has 2 game modes and pixely graphics. If you want a beautiful game, this isn't it. It IS a very fun game, however, and with 20 different endings a fun game to play. To unlock the second game mode, you have to get a certain ending, which I think is cool and the ending is one of the hardest ones to get. Theres many layers, and the game gets more difficult as you play. It may seem like the same thing over and over but is surprisingly amusing and has a very intracate underlying story with a powerful message. 10/10 IMO",1,0

Can't say I've played too many 'document thrillers', but I might just have to play summore if this is what I can expect!

239030,"Papers, Please","It might not sound interesting at first to be an inspector of the border control but this seemingly simple game can keep you occupied for hours because it is really addicting. You want to know each of the possible 20 endings after all and find out every little secret the game has.  The atmosphere is also really well done, since you have to make enough money to feed your family, while you only earn money if you don't make any mistakes. At the same time, though, you are on a schedule so you can't take too much time.  All this is reinforced by the simple graphics which suit the game perfectly. And if you completed the story, there still is an endless mode with different features and difficulties, so in my eyes worth the money.  I give a 5/5, 10/10 or 100/100, whatever you prefer.

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ingredients 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 3/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon fine salt  Directions 1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)  2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.  3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.  4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.  5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.  For a Rocky Road Bar: 1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is truly incredible. Despite essentially being a paper stamping simulator, I agonized over my decisions more in this game than in most ganes with 'moral choice'. It's amazing how engaging looking for discrepancies in paperwork can be when there's a timer ticking away and your ability to feed your family depends on how many people you process. I came to dread the sound of a citation being printed, meaning that I'd made a mistake. In doing this, the game does a great job of destroying your empathy for the potential immigrants, then brings it back for just long enough for you to feel like a terrible person. In other words, I loved it.  My only problem is that the gane doesn't really make you care that much about your family, so I didn't feel as bad as I should've for only feeding them every other day.",1,0

Yet, suprisingly, it manages to transform a mundane inspection job into a simplistic game with addictive gameplay and high replayability value for the moral choices and endings.  Never have I felt so satisfied admitting immigrants only to find out some of them carry bad influences into Arstotzka, your country.   In some days, you will be shocked to see some fake documents and crazy people that will force you to upgrade your inspection tools.  The difficulty is about right. It eventually ramps out a little bit faster than you think, but it is still not too difficult.  There are some memorable moments when you realize you've made some mistakes and then *boom* someone dies because of your error.  It features two modes; story mode and endless mode.  The flaw that I can find is the music is not too impressive and repetitive.  Well, at the end of the day, this game is worth buying.   Score: 8.5/10 'Cool Job. Glory to Arstotzka.'",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers Please is a paper stamping, document checking thriller that is set in a dystopian society modelled on the USSR during the Cold War.   The story? Well you were chosen by the October Labour Lottery to serve your great country of Arstotzka by working at the East Grestin border checkpoint. You have to basically check through papers and make sure people are cleared for entry. After a couple of days, you will be contacted by some rebels. Do you help them? That is up to you. A woman trying to enter on an expired document to see her son that she hasn’t seen in 6 years. Do you let her in? All these decisions and more you will have to make during your play through and, depending on what you do and who you let in, depends on which of the 20 different endings you will get.   The gameplay is basically checking through documents and either approving their entry or denying them. You can chose either, you are not forced to deny someone because they have drugs on them, and they might offer some money to let them in. Money you desperately need. As the game progresses, you are given more paperwork to look though and will have to be very vigilant as they might have discrepancies, but they will be very slight as opposed to a completely different name on a passport like you will have at the start of the game. It is a very rewarding game and every time you let someone through and do not receive a citation, you do feel very pleased with yourself.   The visuals are very blocky and will resemble an 8-bit type graphics, but it works perfectly in this game, reflecting the backwardness of Soviet era technology. Every person is different and you have to make sure the person handing you the documents is the same person on the passport photo, so the graphics are a step up from 8-bit. The writing on the documents is not difficult to read at all and is very clear. The colours are very dull, which captures the feeling of Soviet Russia fantastically and builds upon the dead end, doomed society that is modelled on. It is a very good game and can be very funny, and very solemn.  Overall it is a fantastic little puzzle game that is well worth the £2.70 odd that I paid during the sales. I liked it so much, I gifted a copy to one of my friends so they could experience what I had experienced. Well worth getting and a must have to any Steam library.   Enjoy your play though and Glory to Arstotzka!   TribalHARRY",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I was doing fine and then I forgot to let a diplomat named Shae through. I was then falsely accused of stealing property owned by the Ministry of Admissions. I was sent to a forced labor camp, and my family back to their village. But I let Jorji through most of the time, and I think that's worth it. &lt;3 u jorji  I restarted from the day Shae was coming through. I let her through. My administrator comes and says I will recieve no more plaques for low citation rates. Jorji comes by again and tells me I can escape to Obristan. I memorize the slip he gives me. The next day an officer tells me I am going to have an information audit the 24th... in 2 days. I steal Obristan passports in order to try to get my family with me in my escape. The next day, after I come home from work, I realize my audit is tomorrow, and I only have enough money to escape by myself. I leave. My wife, son, niece, and mother-in-law are sent back to their village. I make it through the Obristan security transport, even with a horridly-forged passport and access slip (thx Jorji's friend). I am free.  10/10 would abandon family again",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a passport stamping simulator, and much more. The game starts off simple: You play as a passport inspector in a 1984-esque totalitarian country, deciding who to allow into the country, with a single stamp. As the game progresses, more and more odious regulations are added, making your job harder over time. At one point I had to inspect FIVE different documents just to decide whether that 80-year old bearded grandpa was a smuggler or not (he was). Right, and there's rents to pay and family members to feed at the end of each day. Tough choices are to be made every day - detain a poor sod for that extra 5 dollars in bribes, or let your son starve for a day. Fail to earn enough money over time, and your family starves to death and its game over.   The graphics, though rudimentary at first glance, as well as the simple 8-bit music perfectly complement the dystopic atmosphere of the game.  But the beauty of this game lies in its masterful storytelling. Through the stamping of passports and little dialogues between characters, you begin to learn more about the world of the inspector; the stories of the characters that pass through your passport booth (including the likeable/destestable smuggler Mr Jorji), as well as the truth of the country he lives in. Between the geopolitical tensions between Arsotka and its neighbours, the terrifying inspector from the 'Ministry of Information' and a border guard's long-lost love, the game draws you in with its simple, yet riveting storytelling.  Glory to Arsotska.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Alright, so I don't usually like games with pixelated graphics. I don't usually like games set in a very communist-like setting. And games don't usually make me feel emotions.   But this game, in all it's pixelated glory, is a GEM. It seems close to impossible to tell such a vivid story through a little border patrol inspection booth, but this game does it and it does it amazingly. This little sucker has a ton of endings, good and bad, and every choice you make is going to affect which one you get. Even the choices that look like they really don't matter, they matter - you just don't find that out until five days later and you get one of the bad endings and the game's over. I did that, it frustrated the living daylights out of me, and it just made me want to play the game even more so I could try again and shoot for a new one.

239030,"Papers, Please","What's the game about?  You work in an American Donut House and customers come in and pay for food. Some you like and you give them extra sugar for their coffee. Some you don't like and you send them away without serving them. Those you really don't like, you send to jail. Also, your boss comes around every now and then to nag you about our poorly you're doing at work.    General feeling after finishing?  WONDERFUL! One of the best games I've played in a while. The story is not complex, but the implications are very nice. I think the art is very in line with the game's theme and I really think the general feeling of working in the conditions presented by the game are close to reality. You memory skills will be tested. And it really provides for a fantastic way to spend you time. Some will surely not call it fun, but again this might just be what makes it a pearl in its right.    Story?  Without it, it wouldn't make much sense, but it's only important in its presentation. You could still get by with a wonderful game if we were talking about assembling computer chips in a factory. Your brain will be tested. Make the right moral decision, but the poor official decision and your boss will not like it.    Gameplay?  Oh, this is the best part of it. Get something right and you get rewarded. Get something wrong and you get penalized (though not at first, though). I'm sure it would work better in a tactile screen but the mouse doesn't distract you that much either.    Graphics?  Pretty simple, but far out. Adds to the complexity of finding out who's a male or female, for example, and that's a very nice touch.    Sound &amp; Music?  You might get a bit tired of it, but it's in line with not only the theme but the imagination of what that country would be. I can't remember anything but the theme, though, so either there was no more music or it wasn't memorable enough.    Replayability?  I did replay it to get to the alternative endings (those I could figure out might make a different), then tried some of the other extra possibilities and then left it at that, the memory of it being all that matters now.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Right, checking people's papers at a virtual border booth does not sound like a game, it really sounds like a drag indeed, can't deny that. But hey, i don't know if you ever read the line 'your choices matter', but this time around they actually do.  Here's the thing, a 90s-like ex-soviet country is opening its borders and you are the one and only employee at the paper-check booth. People are waiting in a line outside for you to take a look at their papers, and as days go by people will be required to present more and more papers and you'll be equipped by the government with any kind of anti-fraud asset you can dream of. But worry not, at the end of the day you're paid based on how many people checked-in at your booth, and your family is waiting at home for you to provide. Provide food, provide rent money, provide heating money, and eventually pay for medical bills should you not take care of them well enough.  Your family members' lives are on your shoulders because apparently they can't do ♥♥♥♥ to save their lives, literally. And just to add shame to shame you'll be caught in the middle of a ground-breaking crisis and will be required to take sides, be with the government or with the revolution. But hey, you're not going to be disappointed with it, because there is a third faction, and that's the people. They talk to you, they tell their stories sometimes, all they need is just a little help, a little push. And you are king of the booth. Laws have you only let in people with certain documents, and them only, but you can do whatever you want inside your booth. Of course whatever you do against the law will be fined, just make sure the bribe is richer than the fine... but then again what are you gonna do? Will you be another government's puppet, will you side with the conspirators, or will you try to help people? Or just you know, skrew over people for your own good? That's an option too!  Anything you do will have consequencies. Even the way you do those things will. If you really are short on cash you can summon the guards on this dude with a forged passport instead of just denying him in, your friend guard will reward you for that. Or you can just let this guy off with a warning, or accept some cash from him to let him in, or whatever he has to offer, or... you know, just let yourself into his sad story and let him in anyway, who knows! Maybe saving this one guy's day today might save yours and your family's life tomorrow, you never know.  Buy it, i'm serious, you want it.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","An absolute masterpiece! I can't believe a game that has the graphics of one of those ancient MS-DOS games can be so addictive and awesome. This is proof that a game doesn't always have to have rich 3D graphics to be successful and entertaining. I picked it up when it was on sale but honestly speaking, I'd gladly pay £15 if I had to. I'd go as far as saying that you can't really put a price on such a game. Games like this are priceless.   As for the length of the game, I heard it can be finished in 3-4 hours but if you are a completionist like me, then expect to invest longer than 10 hours or even more. There's an 'endless' mode you get when you finish the game and that in my opinion increases the replayability manifold. I'm now waiting for a sequel.

Something weird is happening behind your back. You notice it. But you can't see what.  Pixelated style is very good for older computers because the game makes a small image big.

The graphics are pretty limited, and things that are pixel-discrepencies often don't count as such to the game; and it's very hard to tell someone's sex, thus making it easy to get warnings/detractions on that front. It was neat getting the perspective of never having anywhere near enough to care for your family, though.  It *might* be most profitable to just immediately either accept or deny applications without checking them -- but I'm not sure on that. At the very least, probably the best way to increase your profitability is to memorize all the surrounding locations, their cities, their insignia, etc. But who has time for that? For your accomodations, you probably should forgo heat the first day, and thence enable it every other day. Maybe do something similar for food.",-1,0

The characters and evolution of the game's political landscape are done in an interesting way that few others would be capable of acomplishing. Papers, Please earns a solid 4/5, being a game like no other.

239030,"Papers, Please","I have very much enjoyed this game, and while playing it, it is not just a simple game as you think it might be.  This game is an examination of conscience  You decide whether to let people in to Artotzka or not, making exceptions and bending the harsh and cruel rules for bribes and other reasons. You begin to question whether or not to let everyone in, detain them, or deny them.  As the game progresses, you get better at cross-examination, while the rules get increasingly tougher, and the terrorist threats seem to be an everyday occurance at the Grestin checkpoint. This puts the pressure on you, making sure you get through enough people to provide heat and food for your family, or to get that next apartment, or the better upgrades for your inspection booth.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game. This game has so much more meaning in it than the game itself. You find out who you will bend the rules for, and who you won't, who you trust, and who you deny on spot for conspiracy.   Yes, buy it, even if it is not on sale. This game is surely worth it.

I have just gotten the perfect ending, which you will not be getting right away when you play for the first time. I usually don't write reviews, but I felt like I had to now. Because the reason this doesn't get a full 10, which it very much deserves, is what happens after you get the perfect ending.  You unlock 'Endless Mode'. I thought that it was a free-roam with customizeable conditions and such. But what it really was was an online challenge mode, with four different game-modes, not customizeable in any way. Heavily leaning towards online-competition.  So for the people that enjoyed the game and would like to keep playing normally after the story finishes, are screwed. There is no way than to redo the story again. Which will get just annoying in the end.  As I said, 7 out of 10.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a game in which you play as a border control officer in a communist country called Arstortzka. A big war has just finished and the borders have only just reopened. You have to check people entering the country to see if their papers are in order and decide wether or not you'll let them into the country. For every person that you let into or deny access to the country you earn 5 dollars, which you really need. We'll get to that later. If you let a person into the country when they have forged documetns or if you deny people with fine papers, at first you'll get a warning. You will get a maximum of two warnings before you'll start receiving penalties. The first penalty will cost you five dollars, the second one ten, the third one fifteen. Back to the money aspect again. After every day of checking passports and other documents you'll see how much money you made. You will have to pay rent, food and heat with the money you earn. With this money you'll have to keep alive a family consisting of you, your wife, your uncle, your son, your mother in law and eventually (when you find out your sister is arrested) your niece, but this is optional. If you can't afford food or heat, your family will get hungry and cold respectively. They may also get sick, in which case you'll have to buy them medicine. If you can't afford rent, it's game over. You'll also come across people which will ask you to let people pass. Their family members, for example. Now you can choose to deny that person because they don't have their papers right, or let them through and lose some of your hard earned money. It's got a morality aspect going on. The game meay seem simple or boring, but it's pulls you in and doesn't let go. You set your teeth in it and discover the country of Arstotzka, the conflicts with other countries and the complex, well thought out world of Papers, Please through your little world of passport checking. The game's story focus weaves in perfectly with the gameplay and can say it's well worth the money.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Unique experience, and definitely worth playing.  First playthrough, when you still learning about the game, about your job and story, is something phenomenal. In ten minutes, you will get a feeling that any of yours decisions can change so much.  You will always be in a hurry to process as many people as you can, but if you make a lot of mistakes, things can quick go out of hands.  Unfortunately, every next playthrough will be less interesting, and this is the biggest problem of the game. After few playthroughs you will probable have all achievements and all endings, and the game doesn't offer much more. You will unlock endless mode, but it will probably be boring for you to play it. At least, it's boring for me.  Other thing that I don't like is economic side of the game, more specifically, the daily costs. Paying for food every day is OK, but paying for the rent every day (you got an apartment from the state), paying for updates and other things, doesn't makes much sense. I understand that daily costs are necessery for creating pressure on the player to earn money, and it's not a big deal, but it has a negative impact on the experience.  8/10",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a surreal indie game in which you play as a border inspector working for the communist country, Arstotzka. The game is full of gray areas that force the player to make difficult decisions. The 'puzzles' get increasingly difficult as the game progresses, with more and more rules being put in place for you to follow. This game is not perfect by any means, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons.   The game starts with you finding out you had been chosen in the 'lottery,' and that you are now forced to become Arstotzka's border inspector. They had recently opened the border, so crowds of people who want to get in are large and unruly, with instances such as terrorism becoming a somewhat common occurance. Everybody who comes up to you for entrance to Arstotzka has a reason for going there, whether it be work or family. It is up to you to decide if they are fit to enter by checking their passports and other documents to make sure they are not counterfeit or missing completely. If you let someone in who doesn't have the proper documents, you will be penalized. This is where the concept of choice appears, as it is up to you to decide if you want to let the desperate people in even if they are not qualified. No matter your decision, the game makes you feel terrible for what you have done. If you let them go, you lose money that you need to spend on rent and medicine for your sick family, which results in a fail-state if it happens to often. If you deny them, you will have to see their hopes and dreams crushed as they discover they may not see their family again.    The game plays fine, but the repetitive gameplay gets old rather fast, so you will often have to take a break to avoid getting too sick of the game. The puzzles start off easy, but get harder as the game progresses. It is a gentle slope, so you will never feel overwhelmed by the amount of things you have to do. It is worth noting that you will likely have to do a lot of reading in order to fully understand how to play the game, and a perfect run is pretty much impossible. The more people you get through the more money you make, but if you go too fast you may make more mistakes which result in more penalties.   The art style of this game is interesting to say the least. People look deformed and sad, which fits in with the bleak setting of the game. There is nothing noteworthy about the graphics, but the gray and brown color scale of the game portray a perfect atmoshere.   Overall, this is a great game that really makes you wonder about the choices you make. The gameplay is quite repetitive, but the tone and setting of the game seem to always bring you back for more. This is a must buy for fans of surreal, atmospheric games.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Great little game if you don't want to get deeply involved in a game for hours on end, but it is also a great game to play for hours on end. The price of the game along side the small download size make it a great time killer.",1,0

Just working to get through the never ending sea of immigrants.  Overall, I love this game. It's got choices that will make your moral compass hurt, sharpshooter skills, and a 'puzzleish' aspect to it with determining who to deny and who to allow. After playing for a few hours straight in endless, it can get to be a bit motonous, but during story mode, it's hard to put down.  I would reccomend this game to pretty much everyone.

239030,"Papers, Please","For some reason this game is a lot more fun than it seems like it should be. You are in charge of a customs booth either allowing people into the country or denying them based on rules that change as the game goes on. There is also a story that develops as you progress through the days and the choices you make can change your entire future. You can play through this game several times and not get the same ending as long as you make slightly difference choices of course. You don't have to sit there and play the whole day, you can play just a little and come back whenever you want. You could even come back a year later since the mechanics are simple and it's more processing the immigrants than quick reflexes and memorizing controls. Highly recommend it and I think everyone should give this a shot if it seems like something you would be interested in trying.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Had been looking into this game for a while, so I caved in when I saw it for sale. So I was somewhat aquaited with the game when I first started paying it, or so I thought. This game threw so many curveballs my way I felt like a major league baseball player at the plate. I found myself creating a routine to checking informaiton, weighting the pros and cons of letting a single person through, and worrying about my dying son (he died) all in one day. All of this can sound like an overwhelming experience, but it felt perfectly balanced throughout the days in-game by working towards more and more to check everyday. You truly feel like you are deciding the fate of Arstotzka with every person you let through and every decision you make. With there being 20 different endingd you are bound to at least get 3 or so of them through a single play through, and the game offeres you a chance to go back to a certian day to change the outcome.   TL:DR If you would like to have an impact on the fate of a single country in the form of an under paid and over worked border checkpoint inspector, then this is the game for you. Lots of fun.

Althought I have to admitthat Papers, Please was really enjoyable game for me as it was a DECENT GAME, that could be played on a weak pc. Alike my IntelCore i3 pc...

It will make it easier to get to see all the endings and get 100% completion since you are able to avoid playing the first day over and over again.  The one problem I had was forgetting what upgrades I've taken in each save. Several times I've tried to use one and forgot I didn't have it yet.  For a paperwork simulation game it is fantastic.

Endless mode is awesome.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","I can subscribe the positive reviews. Mostly bought it out of curiousity and because of the very good feedback here and I can say it´s a real great and interesting game. Proves the point, that you can create an excellent game with only 50 MB that beats many high graphic and sound based ones easily, by a great idea. But I agree, it can give you a headache and feeling exhausted after playing it for several hours, you have to concentrate a lot to succeed.. Concentration will just reduce naturally after several hours, its fun, but also stressy fun.  You will get a cynical political satire on the horror of daily mechanisms in totalitarian governments; the thrill of power over stamping, passports and people; the fear and fun of disobeying; the detective sports of hunting potential criminals; the morale ambiguity of following the rules by the book or punishing people; the economical pressure to keep your family and yourselve alive, just for continuing with the game and last but not least - time is money, also in totalitarian countries.  Not enough with that, you will be confronted with terrorist attacks at check points, bribes and daily changing rules in a bureaucratic system. If you always wanted to get an idea about, how a person in a job like this might feel, this might teach you a little lesson. But if you just don´t like refugees, I also highly recommand it.   It made me think about it, after I took my first break. More than most other games are ever able to do. It has changed my point of view on games (size does not matter). It´s totally worth the money, don´t wait for Sale. If you are able to get the idea behind it. It is also like the experience of those game for the C64 in the 80ies, people played like crazy days and nights. You can replay it. Probably a lot. I have played 9 hours with only short break during my first session.  Try easy, if you don´t, you risk a headache and being frustrated with failing too often.  This game is excellent.

239030,"Papers, Please","It plays a bit like a restaurant owner type game, in the sense that people are in a line, the more people you process the more money you make, tips (or bribes), etc.  But it adds a very powerful story to this concept, in which you struggle to support your family, and face difficult decisions whether to accept or deny entry. There are 20 different endings you can reach based on your choices, so I'm interested to see what they all are.  I have only 2 complaints about this game.  1. the keyboard shortcuts cost in-game money. At least it's not real money, but still. It feels like something that should be available all the time, without cost. 2. Some of the more obvious discrepancies should be easier to select. For example, if someone has a gun taped to their back, you have to flip to the rules page, move everything else out of the way, and highlight the gun and the rule for not allowing weapons.   Still a great game overall, and the best out of the games I got in the summer sale that I've played so far. Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of my favorite games of all time and I have finished it atleast 5 times and plan to keep on playing it over and over. I bought the game on GoG first and then bought it on Steam. I think this is a one of a kind game, its smart, yet deceptively simple. The dystopian oppresive regime setting of Arstotzka (clearly influenced from Soviet Russia) is very bleak and life is tough. If you can't afford to pay for heat or food, family members will die. If you can't pay for rent, then well I guess it's game over!  I think this game is very much fun to roleplay, I would suggest doing the first playthrough being 'good' and helping out people in need, and just acknowledging the oppression of Arstotzka. Then it's fun to do another playthrough being 'bad', where you are honorable to Arstotzka. Still, I think this is one of the best indie games I have ever played, and I would really like a sequel if possible! (even though the dev stated that there won't be) Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a surreal indie game in which you play as a border inspector working for the communist country, Arstotzka. The game is full of gray areas that force the player to make difficult decisions. The 'puzzles' get increasingly difficult as the game progresses, with more and more rules being put in place for you to follow. This game is not perfect by any means, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons.   The game starts with you finding out you had been chosen in the 'lottery,' and that you are now forced to become Arstotzka's border inspector. They had recently opened the border, so crowds of people who want to get in are large and unruly, with instances such as terrorism becoming a somewhat common occurance. Everybody who comes up to you for entrance to Arstotzka has a reason for going there, whether it be work or family. It is up to you to decide if they are fit to enter by checking their passports and other documents to make sure they are not counterfeit or missing completely. If you let someone in who doesn't have the proper documents, you will be penalized. This is where the concept of choice appears, as it is up to you to decide if you want to let the desperate people in even if they are not qualified. No matter your decision, the game makes you feel terrible for what you have done. If you let them go, you lose money that you need to spend on rent and medicine for your sick family, which results in a fail-state if it happens to often. If you deny them, you will have to see their hopes and dreams crushed as they discover they may not see their family again.    The game plays fine, but the repetitive gameplay gets old rather fast, so you will often have to take a break to avoid getting too sick of the game. The puzzles start off easy, but get harder as the game progresses. It is a gentle slope, so you will never feel overwhelmed by the amount of things you have to do. It is worth noting that you will likely have to do a lot of reading in order to fully understand how to play the game, and a perfect run is pretty much impossible. The more people you get through the more money you make, but if you go too fast you may make more mistakes which result in more penalties.   The art style of this game is interesting to say the least. People look deformed and sad, which fits in with the bleak setting of the game. There is nothing noteworthy about the graphics, but the gray and brown color scale of the game portray a perfect atmoshere.   Overall, this is a great game that really makes you wonder about the choices you make. The gameplay is quite repetitive, but the tone and setting of the game seem to always bring you back for more. This is a must buy for fans of surreal, atmospheric games.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Great little game if you don't want to get deeply involved in a game for hours on end, but it is also a great game to play for hours on end. The price of the game along side the small download size make it a great time killer.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Life in Arstotzka has taught me that family is a burden one must shed in order to pay the utility bill. With my pesky kin out the way, I focused mostly on the power trip that comes with ruling the Grestin Border Checkpoint. Papers, Please makes this easy by sending drug-smugglers, terrorists, revolutionaries, shady criminals, and desperate refugees, all coming to prostrate themselves at my stamp. However, the day-to-day trivialities do end up souring the wine that is my dominion/booth. This game would perhaps be better if I conscripted a serf to do the actual work, while I hold all the passports in my iron fist.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This is a nice game that you should give a try, (bad luck cause it was on summer sale when i bought it). Its storyline is'nt as thick as the other games. Not to mention that the whole gameplay is at times frustrating ( alike surgeon simulator), because you have to really put effort to see if there is'nt any discrepencies, ( paperwork problems, non-matching info etc), also you HAVE TO FINISH THE STORYMODE TO UNLOCK THE ENDLESS MODE. soo get it if you are patient gamer ... Althought I have to admitthat Papers, Please was really enjoyable game for me as it was a DECENT GAME, that could be played on a weak pc. Alike my IntelCore i3 pc...

239030,"Papers, Please",This is one of the most absorbing games I've played in a while. Got it recently since it was on sale and I keep finding myself going back to play again. It is very easy for a few hours to go by playing this.  I really like how you can branch off from a particular day just to do something different. It will make it easier to get to see all the endings and get 100% completion since you are able to avoid playing the first day over and over again.  The one problem I had was forgetting what upgrades I've taken in each save. Several times I've tried to use one and forgot I didn't have it yet.  For a paperwork simulation game it is fantastic. Even if it isn't on sale I would recommend checking it out.,1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Had been looking into this game for a while, so I caved in when I saw it for sale. So I was somewhat aquaited with the game when I first started paying it, or so I thought. This game threw so many curveballs my way I felt like a major league baseball player at the plate. I found myself creating a routine to checking informaiton, weighting the pros and cons of letting a single person through, and worrying about my dying son (he died) all in one day. All of this can sound like an overwhelming experience, but it felt perfectly balanced throughout the days in-game by working towards more and more to check everyday. You truly feel like you are deciding the fate of Arstotzka with every person you let through and every decision you make. With there being 20 different endingd you are bound to at least get 3 or so of them through a single play through, and the game offeres you a chance to go back to a certian day to change the outcome.   TL:DR If you would like to have an impact on the fate of a single country in the form of an under paid and over worked border checkpoint inspector, then this is the game for you. Lots of fun.   Glory to Arstotzka! ~In loving memory of my son",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I bought Papers, Please quite a while before writing this review, but I just keep coming back to play it some more . . . That's the sign of a great game.  I love the story. The dystopian Arstotzka is a fantastic setting that is effectively depicted through the daily bulletins and the immigrants you see, and you're given so many great morally ambiguous choices to make - you may want to help someone out, but you know it'll cost you a deduction in your pay and you've got a family to keep healthy. Do you help, or do your duty? There's also a lot of story choices involved that definitely impacts how things turn out (in huge ways), and there's a ton of little plotlines to see. Sometimes you'll be excited, sometime's you'll be anxious, sometimes sad, and sometimes heartwarmed. This game's got it all, and there's numerous endings to fit what you've chosen!  The gameplay is also brilliant - it seems like checking increasingly large stacks of immigration papers for discrepencies would get really boring really fast, but it just . . . doesn't. New rules and things to look out for are constantly being given to you to keep things fresh, and while this can get a little overwhelming, the game's difficulty perfectly rides the line between immersing you in the game and being slightly too hard. Papers, Please *is* challenging to play well, there's no doubt, but I don't think it's ever unfair and feeling slightly overwhelmed by the game is entirely appropriate, given its setting and story.  The artwork is great, too. It's a bit unusual, but really fits the tone of the game and looks very good. (Same thing goes for the music!)  Overall, I cannot recommend enough that you at least *try* the game, maybe buy it on sale if you're on the fence about it, but I think it's well worth the asking price!",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","This game is really good and i enjoy playing it for many reasons, the 'story' develops based on your decisions in the game. There are 20 different endings, some are expected others come with a plot twist, obeying every rule in the game may not lead you to a satisfactory ending. The main character of the game is the head of the familly and everyday he needs to pay expenses to keep his familly happy, the daily pay is proportional to the number of people you control and as the week goes by it gets harder to keep up.  You may not like this game becouse it's 'too repetitive' but i assure you that if you take into account what would be the consequence of letting people into 'your' country you would see things less repetitive.",1,0

This is proof that a game doesn't always have to have rich 3D graphics to be successful and entertaining. I picked it up when it was on sale but honestly speaking, I'd gladly pay £15 if I had to. I'd go as far as saying that you can't really put a price on such a game. Games like this are priceless.   As for the length of the game, I heard it can be finished in 3-4 hours but if you are a completionist like me, then expect to invest longer than 10 hours or even more. There's an 'endless' mode you get when you finish the game and that in my opinion increases the replayability manifold. I'm now waiting for a sequel.

Having to dig through an applicant's pile of documents to check all of the information, and make sure it all adds up while keeping in line with a dozen different border rules and regulations is insanely fun to juggle.

239030,"Papers, Please","I started playing Papers Please for the third time and I am still impressed about how well it is put together. The graphics are only on par with NES but they take advantage of the lack of polish to make a very bleak and oppressve world.  On one hand the game feels like working a day job (complete with an unhappy boss if you screw something up), but I like this becuase it forces you to pay more attention to what you are doing. You have to read and understand everything going on in the world or you might slip up, and the more mistakes you have against you the less money you make.  That's another thing - you really get the feeling that you are struggling to make ends meet, and you feel it at the end of every day. It motivates you to want to do better so you can keep food on the table and heat your home. I'm sure it sounds like a cliche to everyone who had working parents, but the game really drives home how important it is and how difficult it can be to live day to day.  The story is very compelling too. The interesting events are notable but at the same time understated compared to most games. Everything just feels like another day even though every one of your actions have definite consequences.  Excellent game, I'm sure I will be playing this for years to come.",1,0

And I have to deny them entry    So anyways, yeah go buy this game. Papers, Please is super addictive! You have to be detail oriented and quick, but it is so much fun.

239030,"Papers, Please","CHECK OUT THE WHOLE REVIEW AT ETHNOGRAPHIX NOTHING BUT GAMING CULTURE AND KATS!   Never thought I'd say this but there's just something weirdly satisfying about a game where your sole job is to do paperwork. Seriously, that's all you do!  In Papers, Please, you play the part of a lucky proletariat picked from a lottery to work at a newly established checkpoint between Soviet Union era-like satellite states. Your job is simple; prevent anyone with false or out of date paperwork passage in or out of the ficticious country of Arstotzka while letting the right ones in.   It's just a wacky good time, processing the flow of depressingly monotonal proletarians to the oppressive thrum of Soviet era propaganda music. The revolving door of characters you encounter are very human in their motives for crossing the border and includes concerned parents, arms dealers, and a beguiling hobo.  Your perspective is as limited as communication with the world outside the grey colored Berlin style city while juxtaposed color palettes off set the drabness of your surroundings. The sound is simple yet precise and at times, the compulsion to lick your thumb before flipping through another page of procedural nonsense is simply overwhelming.  The process is intuitive and not too precise in the sense that where you stamp or place paperwork is not a set thing, allowing for a kind of freedom that is severely lacking in more cerebral titles such as Papers, Please. As a result, you'll find that your in-game desk quickly becomes a reflection of your very own in terms of organization and tidiness. Expect the random pipe bomb thrown from the grey clad masses to disperse the crowd which will thus bring about more stringent and meticulous scrutiny from your bosses.   Check out Papers, Please if you're looking for a more cerebral challenge and have the desire to feel like another cog in an Eastern Block ghetto.

It may seem like there is not much to the game, but the story makes the whole game realistic with terrorist attacks, secret groups of people to take down countries, and checkups from authorities that don't trust you at all. Not only is the story really good, the gameplay balances the whole game out. It gets so overwhelming trying to keep up with all the new rules, all the attacks, and the lack of trust, that if the art style was different, it would feel like i was right in the game.

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is one of my favorite games of all time and I have finished it atleast 5 times and plan to keep on playing it over and over. I bought the game on GoG first and then bought it on Steam. I think this is a one of a kind game, its smart, yet deceptively simple. The dystopian oppresive regime setting of Arstotzka (clearly influenced from Soviet Russia) is very bleak and life is tough. If you can't afford to pay for heat or food, family members will die. If you can't pay for rent, then well I guess it's game over!  I think this game is very much fun to roleplay, I would suggest doing the first playthrough being 'good' and helping out people in need, and just acknowledging the oppression of Arstotzka. Then it's fun to do another playthrough being 'bad', where you are honorable to Arstotzka. Still, I think this is one of the best indie games I have ever played, and I would really like a sequel if possible! (even though the dev stated that there won't be) Glory to Arstotzka!",1,0

In a world where games are mostly violent shooters, or cute and cuddly games, or games with little variation churned out by huge companies, Papers Please is a breath of fresh air. In the beginning you want to obey the game, don't let in that woman, even if it will unlock a secret. Don't follow the order, even if doing it right gets you the best ending. Even trying to not care about your virtual family, who are never seen or named, only known as OK, COLD, SICK, HUNGRY, is not seen as a good thing to do. I must not accept these bribes, they could mess up my track record! My family can go without food tonight. After a while, your heart softens. This guy seems cool, and it's just a silly citation, I'll let him in. My son desperately wants this expensive birthday present. I'll buy it. My niece needs to be adopted. She can some, it's fine.

Also your morals are tested as you can risk getting a penalty to accept a bribe or let a woman see her husband depite the fact that her passport contains some errors. Multiple endings make this game full of replayability, but it can sometimes get repetitive depending on the direction you are going making it sort of a chore sometimes. This game can sharpen your skills in being observant and efficient as you have a limited time to earn as much money as you can in order to purchase your basic needs.

Would you help a confused man who you see time and time again gain access to your country or will you turn him away at every chance? Will you risk your job and the life of your family simply for the safety of a person you do not know and will never see again?

239030,"Papers, Please","An excellent videogame. Papers, Please is a very deep and sometimes moving game. You play as a border inspector, accepting and denying people into 'The Great Sovereign Nation of Arstotzka'. There's stamps, entry permits, ID supplements, contraband, guns, terrorism, drugs, smugglers, nudity, passports, bribes, fingerprints, and behind it all, the M.O.A (Ministry of Admission). My only complaint is I've played 6.4 hours, and recieved no card drops. But that's besides the point. Your name was pulled in the October labor lottery. You are obliged to buy this game. 10/10  P.S.

239030,"Papers, Please","An oddly captivating game. Starting with the bad. Papers Please has only the roughest, most pixilated graphics, which is generally a big turn off for me, but somehow works for this game most of the time. It only sometimes becomes annoying when things can get hard to read or when you are supposed to recognixe details about a person, but it's hard to tell from a 12 pixel face. It also only has two scenes (outside or inside the shack), but dispite that, it managest to tell a captivating story and be an engaging and challenging game. Perpare yourself for moral delemas and hard decisions that need to be made quickly.   Something that may be a turn off to some casual gamers is that this game is timed (by nature of the plot), so every second counts. This is not a sit back and chill sort of game. It's more of an intense attention and memory test that will get your heart rate up as the timer is counting down for the day and your family is cold and hungry and counting on you. Do you guess or take the time to know for sure? Do you help a stranger or ensure your family is safe? These are the sorts of pickles Papers Please will put you in. The multitude of options allows for a lot of replayability, and it gets a little easier with experience, so don't get frustrated if you don't make it far at first.   8/10 great plot and game design, could use a graphics update.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","It plays a bit like a restaurant owner type game, in the sense that people are in a line, the more people you process the more money you make, tips (or bribes), etc.  But it adds a very powerful story to this concept, in which you struggle to support your family, and face difficult decisions whether to accept or deny entry. There are 20 different endings you can reach based on your choices, so I'm interested to see what they all are.  I have only 2 complaints about this game.  1. the keyboard shortcuts cost in-game money. At least it's not real money, but still. It feels like something that should be available all the time, without cost. 2. Some of the more obvious discrepancies should be easier to select. For example, if someone has a gun taped to their back, you have to flip to the rules page, move everything else out of the way, and highlight the gun and the rule for not allowing weapons.   Still a great game overall, and the best out of the games I got in the summer sale that I've played so far. Glory to Arstotzka.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a game that when first looked at, sounds like the worst concept of a game. 'Play as an immigration officer that checks the legal documents of travelers.' The beautiful part of Papers, Please is that that statement is true, and yet it plays as an engaging, nuanced game that has most of what good games should have. However, the games mechanics and narrative are niche, and if you find yourself not liking this game, there are valid reasons.  The game is simple to pick up as you learn the basics of what you need to do, checking to make sure all the information is correct, according to the guidelines the game gives you. The difficulty ramps up as more documents are added and sometimes made obsolete. You must process more and more people through the checkpoint in order to make more money to provide for your family, which while you don't have to keep alive to 'win', you will find yourself working harder to make sure your family is warm, as you have a vested emotional interest.   This pressure to perform at max efficiency will gnaw at you to be faster and faster, which causes you to make mistakes, and the more mistakes you make you will lose money. So Papers, Please is a game about being an obsessive fact checker, making sure every detail is in order, and if you do a good job you can buy upgrades that make you even more efficient, and things to make your family even happier and safer.  The story of Papers, Please is linked to the people going through your booth, and I won't give any spoilers, because you will want to experience these stories first hand. You will listen to the stories these people have of needing to cross the border, but they don't have the right papers. You have to decide, 'WIll I risk my family going without food for a night, to let this man avoid being shot?' And keep in mind, do you even know why he might be shot? This isn't a game of right and wrong, black and white morality so much as it is one of having to choose between two desperately needed options of people trying to survive, but you have to choose how much you can trust and hope when you need to make sure you are safe as well.  Alongside this depressing story is a setting and soundtrack that forces you into an emotionally tired mindset. The theme is engrossing in it's exhausted proudness: its a song you will hear at the start of the game, almost like the national anthem of Arstotzka, the nation you play in. You, as a citizen, must be fiercely loyal each day, despite being worn down by lack of money, hope, and options. The colors are muted and broken by the occasional bright blue or yellow in the form of awards and story options. These drive you to act because you just want to see what a glimmer of salvation is like in this Commmunist Satellite State aesthetic.  And while all of that is amazing, there is a few things you should keep in mind. I'm loathe to use the phrase 'not for everyone', but it certainly applies here. The game is stylized to make something traditionally boring into an engaging experience, but if you are someone who prefers a game that doesn't need to be artsy to be fun, Papers, Please may be too pretentious for you. Note, that does not make you simple or someone who doesn't appreciate theme driven mechanics, but I think we can all agree that some games don't click, just as a popular movie or book may not.  Furthermore, when I have introduced friends to this game, they find it too 'untraditional' in that it isn't your typical game. The theme, objective, and narrative are all against what well known games are notable for. I largely agree with this, and if you find youself as a casual gamer in the sense that you play games for fun, rather than a hobby, only with friends, or to see how it evolves as a form of media, then this game also may not be for you.  This game should run on your computer with no problems due to it's clean but simple pixel graphics. No framerate issues, random crashes, save glitches, corruption problems. Whether you like the game or not, it will run smooth.  In conclusion, this game will be hit or miss for you, and thats ok. You'll find yourself getting into the character, role playing how you have to provide for you family, serve as a loyal citizen of Arstotzka, check papers faster and faster, and deal with a wide variety of story options that change how you think each day. Or, you'll find yourself looking at a game that, while interesting in concept, accomplishes it too well, and is a boring task too similar to work for you to enjoy.  In any case, I highly suggest giving Papers, Please a chance. This purchase could open the door for many other similar games that you'll fall in love with, or will tell you that those games aren't your cup of tea.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","If you ever wanted to know what it's like to have to sit in a booth and experience a gamified version of the banality of being a customs officer (and have it be fun), here's your chance. 'Papers, Please' is a sometimes maddening game of 'What Doesn't Belong' with some additional story elements of intrigue along with the joy of trying to survive as an underpaid, underappreciated border control agent. Once you get things down, the game changes them on you. In addition to some of the story elements, there's also a lightweight management element (personal money, time, family), and penalties (in the form of citations, which can cost you money, or game ends, which can send you to prison and other places).  The game becomes cathartic after you get into the rhythm of it, but you have to have an eye for catching differences and details, otherwise you'll find yourself prone to losing credits. Overall, a really fun game which manages to make something that nobody would think is fun into something fun.  Likes + Matching/Puzzling under pressure + Lightweight storylines + Lightweight personal management  Dislikes + Wish there was an endless mode without constrains ('catharsis mode' -- play endlessly to relax; no time limits, no points penalties, no instant death on failure.

239030,"Papers, Please","A good game can create a unique environment that the player takes part in. Papers Please is one of those games. Although Papers Please barely ever leaves your small inspection desk in the corrupt communist country of Arstotzka (glory!) Lucas Pope is able to create an expansive universe where you feel fully involved. The game itself doesn't have much to it; it is beautifully simple and at some times annoyingly challenging. The overall goal is to make enough money inspecting travel papers to feed your family. You can do this by following every regulation, taking bribes, catching criminals, letting criminals through, or secretly leading a revolution. It doesn't matter, play the way you want to play. What really makes the game great is the setting. From East Grestin to the United Fed, the politics and controversy in the world surrounding your low-paying job is what makes Papers Please feel different from most games. Although it takes place in a large, complicated world with 7 giant countries, you hardly ever see the game outside of your work station. Instead, you get word of what is going on through immigrants and emmigrants coming and going through your inspection booth. Terrorists and secret societies demonstarte conficts outside and inside countries. You may not directly see the universe Lucas Pope creates, but you definitely feel like you're living in it.  TL;DR - Papers Please may be a simple game, but it creates a vast universe that you feel like you're taking part in, even if you don't see it first hand.  Side note: Many people seem to dislike this game because it wasn't what they expected it to be. You have to know that Papers Please is a PUZZLE GAME. It has a good storyline and a unique playstyle, but when it gets down to the basics, it is essentially a 'spot the difference' sort-of thing.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Papers, Please is a subtle game that snuck up on me. I started out playing like I normally would, listening to sob stories and stamping approvals even with missing or incorrect documents, aiding the resistance, and trying to be a caring border guard.  After being jailed multiple times, my entire family dying on me, and other miseries befalling me my playstyle started to shift. Today I found myself barely listening to the conversation of the travelers, picking out their purpose and dates only to see if they matched their documents. A woman approaches, I note she's missing a permit, she starts to talk instead of handing over the document, her pleas that if she is denied she will be killed in her home country barely register as I stamp Denied and flip her back her passport. I let through a pimp a woman begged me to deny earlier as all his documents were correct, and he flips me a card advertising his merchandise. I groan as another Kolechian decides to bomb the border cutting my day and paycheck short.  My transformation is complete, I am a cog in an autocratic machine carrying out my duties to the state. Uncaring, unfeeling, the dystopian state has broken me and molded me to fit their needs.",1,0

You're an employee hired by the state of Arstotzka to control migratory flow to the border.

I never imagined that the story behind such a simplistic game could be so immersive and interesting. I know many games say that but the story in this game is really influenced in the way you play it and how good you are in it. So i have to say that i mostly got bad endings in the beginning. The game isnt very long but once you get to one ending you can start at any day you want to get a different outcome, and let me say there are so many endings!

239030,"Papers, Please","Would you break the rules at a border check to reunite a family?  Would you approve dangerous people with legitimate passports?  Would you put yourself and your family at risk to help someone else?  Would you help someone if it meant risking outbreak of disease?   Papers, Please isn't a game that forces a particular issue or crams such things down your throat (e.g. Press F to Feel), but it does introduce you to some pretty interesting scenarios (with no definite correct response) during your time at the Arstotska border check. Surrounding these questions, however, is a very entertaining 'paper simulator' that sees you checking documents for inconsistencies and approving or denying entry. Overall, the game provides a suprisingly rich experience and your actions throughout lead to a variety of different endings (I think 20 in all), providing a lot of room for replaying the game (especially after unlocking endless modes).   One of the best indie games around. Definitely recommended.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","Glory to Arstotzka    Though a greatly thought provoking and engaging experience, 'Papers, Please' presents itself as about as boring of a game premise that one can imagine. You are a lowly border admissions officer of fictional communist state Arstotzka; checking documentation, denying entry to Kolechian scum, getting threatened by your boss for any mistake, and being paid pennies to do so while under constant threat of ending up in a windowless cell. If you do your job well, you may be able to earn enough money to both heat your home and feed your family. This aspect of the game is at most times tedious and a bit nerve-wracking.  Where 'Papers, Please' truly shines is the story, moved forward through decisions you are faced with. A woman is missing a new piece of documentation and pleads for entry to see her son? Jorji comes in with his crayon-drawn passport yet again? A person pleads for you to deny entry though all their documents are in order? Based on how you act in these situations will unfurl a wonderful series of stories, though you never leave that guard booth. The impacts of each decision is often felt both immediately and through later game events.  Each playthrough is generally brief, lasting only 20-30 minutes, but if you enjoy the game there are a variety of different endings to achieve.   In short, I feel 'Papers, Please' is worth a purchase for the experience at the very least. I've played few games which have been so thought provoking and unique.",1,0

One of the things that strike me the most is that the creator has been able to set a mood for the game although the game itself is extremely minimal. Only roughly 40Mb in dl. The intro screen, the music, the interface.. It all adds to it. No fancy 3D graphics required.  This being said, Papers, Please required some kind of maturity though. I don't think younger gamers will find it any fun to check the validity of codes, dates and stamps on documents. Also not sure they will be grasping the whole communism thing.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is absolutely brilliant. The gameplay of scrutinising documents for errors is actually really fun and intensely engaging, as you feel under pressure to work quickly since you are on commission and need money to provide for your family. The difficulty ramps up as security in the dystopia tightens, and so you are required to do more work without an increase in pay. Your small desk becomes increasingly cluttered with documents and gives an impression of claustrophobia and an increasingly unreasonable workload. You are also faced with moral decisions between letting people in without proper documentation (thereby being financially penalised for your mistake), or denying them entry but feeling guilty as hell about it. The game has an overarching story that can play out different ways depending on the choices you make; I think there is about 30 different endings. It is one of the most original games I have ever played and I think everyone should own it.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","This game is the reason why I started preferring indie games over triple A titles. The premise is simple, you are a frontier guard in charge of passport control in what seems to be an eastern European country during the soviet regime. Your job is to check every immigrant's papers and allow or deny their entrance.  I really like this being random although there are certain key events that always play the same way. These tell the story of rebellion against the local government, a terrorist organization, corruption and some other mature themes.  The art does seem dated but the game need no fancy graphics to be entertaining. It keeps getting more and more complicated as new laws are passed to further increase border control and you may choose to play it safe, ally with the rebel or benefit you and your family from helping catching spies. It is a cold war drama that resembles reality quite interestingly.  I really recommend this game for anyone who likes cold war stories, finding the differences kind of games, or just a very well executed idea.",1,0

239030,"Papers, Please","I wish I could write exactly how I feel about this game but it will never do it a fraction of justice. I will try too though, damn I love this game in every way.  You are just some person working a menial job, even at first it seems a little tedious (See below for a more positive note.) but you have a family to support and this is your day job. I work full time so an emulation of tedium isn't so appealing at first, why would I want to enter that World again?  It starts off easy but tedious, each day brings new difficulties and more tedium. What makes this game what it is in it's immersion. The characters you encounter make it what it is, the decisions you make shape the enter game itself. It brings about such minor decisions which can effect certain characters in major ways. Every decision you make will effect the ending and there are many endings. Do you stay loyal or do you rebel? Do you turn a cheek to help your family for own needs or be strict and let your family suffer? That five credit fine for a twenty credit bribe could make a lot of difference.  I know this game has been out for some time, has won a lot of awards and is most likely out of a lot of people's memories. But I'm writing this review for anyone sitting on the fence. Buy it! Even at full price, you won't regret it! The tedium and increased difficulty is overshadowed by an intricate multipathed storyline which will just cloud your judgement at every turn. There's some secrets to discover too.  Even if you try to be the nice guy, there's parts of it where you just want to be a ♥♥♥♥ the next time. This is one game with a lot of options and outcomes for your actions and each playthrough will never be the same.  Note: The main game play is never actually tedious, it's just a fun challenge which increases the difficulty with each day. Once you've got the hang of how it works the first few days are a gold mine. The best experiences are found in exploring the decisions you have made and exploring different options each time afterwards.  I have nothing negative to say about this game. I'm just glad it exist's and will thrust it upon any person who is looking for something to play.  tl;dr Buy and play this game!",1,0

That task gets tougher everday, because you have to earn money to pay your rent and provide for your family. And you only get enough money if you are fast and don't make mistakes at your job.   But tahts only half of it. Sometimes there are attacks on the border and opportunities to make a little extra money. On the other hand you are able to help people by letting them in or letting other people not in who are endangerin them. But your employer won't look kindly on that kind off behavior.

Anyway, I really think that the best way to know if you'll like this game is to play it, because it really is one of those 'marmite' things. If you appreciate playing something a little different every now and then, however, I really do recommend this. It has unique gameplay and graphics, and actually has an Idea behind it - one it manages to explore without making it feel like the gameplay is merely a vehicle for the idea (I think the two intermesh very well, personally).

239030,"Papers, Please","If you ever wanted to know what it's like to have to sit in a booth and experience a gamified version of the banality of being a customs officer (and have it be fun), here's your chance. 'Papers, Please' is a sometimes maddening game of 'What Doesn't Belong' with some additional story elements of intrigue along with the joy of trying to survive as an underpaid, underappreciated border control agent. Once you get things down, the game changes them on you. In addition to some of the story elements, there's also a lightweight management element (personal money, time, family), and penalties (in the form of citations, which can cost you money, or game ends, which can send you to prison and other places).  The game becomes cathartic after you get into the rhythm of it, but you have to have an eye for catching differences and details, otherwise you'll find yourself prone to losing credits. Overall, a really fun game which manages to make something that nobody would think is fun into something fun.  Likes + Matching/Puzzling under pressure + Lightweight storylines + Lightweight personal management  Dislikes + Wish there was an endless mode without constrains ('catharsis mode' -- play endlessly to relax; no time limits, no points penalties, no instant death on failure.

One of the things that strike me the most is that the creator has been able to set a mood for the game although the game itself is extremely minimal. Only roughly 40Mb in dl. The intro screen, the music, the interface.. It all adds to it. No fancy 3D graphics required.  This being said, Papers, Please required some kind of maturity though. I don't think younger gamers will find it any fun to check the validity of codes, dates and stamps on documents. Also not sure they will be grasping the whole communism thing.",1,0

It drips with atmosphere, the music is grippingly threatening, characters are empathetic, and you truly feel overwhelmed with responsibility - do the 'right thing' by not accepting a bribe, or take the bribe in order to feed your family? It's the best kind of karma system, where your decisions have direct consequences, rather than an arbitrary 'good vs. evil' meter. If I had any complaint, it's that I wish there was no time limit during missions, if only so I could take my time; however, the time limit does add to the intensity and it forces you to make hasty decisions, so I cannot rightfully criticize the game for that.

The rules are always changing, so you have to remember slightly different rules every day. There are over 25 things that could make someone unable to pass the border, and YOU need to find each and every one of them. There are only several minutes to complete as many clients as possible, so time is of great concern. And since you are paid by the client, and you have a family to keep alive, time is even more pressing.

239030,"Papers, Please","10/10 would recommend - the vision is dystopian, the job mundane and soul crushing, the people unhappy and resentful, the moral choices increasingly complex as the game progresses. Surprisingly compelling and loads of replay value for different possible endings, and laced with black humour. Worth the full price.",1,0

It’s up to you, No easy decisions are made here making it truly impacting your state of mind.  What makes the game mechanic more interesting is the moral dilemma it bombards you with, will you take a bribe to help your family survive another day by granting entry to a drug dealer to furthermore increase your income; or help a loving wife without the proper entry documentation unite with her husband and in the process getting penalized with a decrease in your income.  The aspect of progression in “Papers, please” is well refined and not just in terms of narrative, the game rewards you with items that you can hang on your wall making the booth feel more and more like your own office as you grow attached to it. The work polices also builds up with the game progression as well some recurring characters making you memories some of them if not all, what this aspect does is make you feel even more as part of the border and this dystopian world.  The game does something few other games in the industry does, which is establishing a mechanic, building on that mechanic so well making you feel you're playing a sequel to the game.  As you progress in the thirty day work period the plot widens with many paths to delve in and choices to make with moral impact affecting you, your family members and your country at large. I have found the moral impact at time so effectively applied I found myself thinking of what choice I should take meanwhile effecting the quality of my job as an inspector, this shows how well-crafted this games is and how much thought was put in stringing many aspects making it a great and well imagined product.  Something worth noting also is the saving system which is represented as a time line, giving you the flexibility of returning to any day of the month and picking up from there, this is worth noting since the game has 20 endings depending on your choices and paths taken, making it easy for you to see all endings  If you’re looking for a game with an innovative idea, engaging, involving experience, a well written narrative, fresh and on top of it on a budget price, I cannot urge you enough to at least try this game as its wonderful experience created with great care craftsmanship.

239030,"Papers, Please","One of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. The gloomy, oppressive mood of Arstotzka permeates through every single moment of the game. You always feel threatened by the government and every single decision you make through the game makes you feel so stressed because every decision may lead you (or your family) to end up in a gulag, or even worse, dead. In other words, this is a perfect 'life in North Korea' simulation. Definitely recommended.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","A great game for those who pay a lot of attention to detail.  I've started a couple of games now and it seems like the same people come in every game, which means that to some extent you can learn who you should and shouldn't let through the border control post you are manning. The game also gets easier as you learn what you are looking for in the documents people are presenting you with - but then it also gets harder as you are given more and more documents to examine.  I've only reached one ending, but it appears that there are many different endings to the game depending on some of the decisions you make through the game.  It's definitely a game I would come back to and play again to see what different endings I can achieve.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please","Best game I've ever played. It's a simple concept really, the concept may be boring but the creator of the game made it fun and entertaining.

There is something so attractive to the game that you can't skip anything. Each passport, each decision will lead you to 1 of many endings.

239030,"Papers, Please","Few jobs are more soul-sucking than sitting at a cramped desk and shuffling paperwork for hours on end. Now imagine doing that in an Eastern Bloc country during the height of the Cold War, with low pay, bleak conditions and the constant threat of being fired - or worse - if you screw up. Tedious, boring and stressful. Ideal subject matter for a video game, no? And yet Papers, Please is an unforgettable experience. It's been dubbed a 'paperwork simulator' - and that's not entirely inaccurate - but it's truly a game about freedom, power and how fleeting and illusory each can be.  An independent game designed by former Naughty Dog programmer Lucas Pope Papers, Please casts players as a border checkpoint officer in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka. Your job is simple, at least in concept: examine the documents of people who are trying to get into the country, and determine whether they're eligible for entry or should be turned away.  At first it's as easy as checking criteria like passport expiry dates, and rejecting paperwork that's invalid or forged. But before long, Papers, Please becomes a tension-filled juggling act. Every new day adds new rules to follow and new layers of complexity, and every time you let mess up, you lose the money you'd have earned for properly processing that batch of paperwork. To give the game a sense of grim consequence, your wages are tallied up at the end of each day, from which you must pay for rent, food, heat and medicine for your family. Despite the retro-flavoured visuals, the act of shuffling virtual papers is actually surprisingly tactile, and spotting a discrepancy and slamming the 'denied' stamp down on a person's passport imparts an odd thrill of power.  With a deluge of big-budget, high-profile games on the horizon, it might be easy to overlook a quiet, unusual game like Papers, Please. But don't do that, comrade. The consequences would be dire.",1,1
